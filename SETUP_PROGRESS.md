## 🚨 **Current Situation Analysis**

### **Existing GitHub Issues (130 issues)**
- **Status:** All issues are from before roadmap restructuring
- **Problem:** Issues don't reflect current `MASTER_PLAN.md` structure
- **Solution:** Need to clean up and replace with new organized issues

### **New MASTER_PLAN.md Structure**
- **99 new issues** from consolidated master plan
- **Organized by phases:** Phase 1-5 with clear priorities
- **Proper labeling:** phase-1, critical, lootfactory, etc.
- **Legal compliance:** D&D Beyond integration requirements

---

## 📋 **Updated Next Steps**

### **Step 1: Clean Up Existing Issues**
1. **Review current issues** to identify what to keep/delete
2. **Archive outdated issues** that don't match new structure
3. **Update relevant issues** to match new roadmap
4. **Prepare for new issue import**

### **Step 2: Create New GitHub Token**
- [x] New GitHub token with correct permissions is available and tested
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Set permissions:
   - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ **issues** (Full control of issues)
   - ✅ **workflow** (Update GitHub Action workflows)
4. Set expiration: "No expiration" or 90 days
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the new token

### **Step 3: Update Script with New Token**
```bash
# Set environment variable
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_new_token_here

# Or run with token inline
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_new_token_here node scripts/import-to-github.js
```

### **Step 4: Test Token**
```bash
# Test the new token
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_NEW_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
     https://api.github.com/user
```

### **Step 5: Run Import with Cleanup**
- Run the import script (will create 99 new issues)
- Review new issues created from `MASTER_PLAN.md`
- Archive old issues that are no longer relevant
- Update existing issues that match new structure
- Verify Linear sync with organized issues

---

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Script Features**
- ✅ Parses `roadmap/MASTER_PLAN.md` for `- [ ]` items
- ✅ Categorizes by phase (1-5)
- ✅ Sets appropriate labels (phase-1, critical, lootfactory, etc.)
- ✅ Uses templates for consistent formatting
- ✅ Handles rate limiting to avoid GitHub API limits
- ✅ Provides summary of created issues

### **Expected Output**
- **99 new issues** from MASTER_PLAN.md
- **Organized by phase:** Phase 1 (Critical), Phase 2 (External Integrations), etc.
- **Proper labels:** phase-1, critical, lootfactory, etc.
- **Consistent formatting:** Template-based issue bodies

## 🔄 **Ongoing Workflow**

### **Once Set Up:**
1. **GitHub Issues** = Single source of truth
2. **Linear automatically syncs** with GitHub Issues
3. **Update issues** in GitHub, Linear stays in sync
4. **No manual sync** required
5. **Professional workflow** that scales

### **Maintenance:**
- Create new issues in GitHub
- Linear automatically imports them
- Update issue status in Linear
- Changes reflect in GitHub automatically

```

This documents everything we've done and what needs to be completed next. The key is getting the GitHub token with the right permissions to create repository issues, then Linear will handle the rest automatically!

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**
- [x] GitHub token with proper permissions
- [ ] Clean up 130 existing issues
- [ ] Create 99 new issues from MASTER_PLAN.md
- [ ] Linear automatically syncs with GitHub
- [ ] Issues organized by phase/priority
- [ ] Professional workflow established

##  **Next Session**
1. Create new GitHub token with proper permissions
2. Update script with new token
3. Run import and verify Linear sync
4. Begin development workflow with Linear MCP
