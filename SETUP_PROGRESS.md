# DMDashboard Setup Progress

## 🎯 **Current Goal**
Set up professional GitHub Issues → Linear workflow for DMDashboard project management.

## 📋 **Completed Steps**

### ✅ **1. Project Consolidation**
- [x] Consolidated planning documents into `roadmap/MASTER_PLAN.md`
- [x] Deleted redundant planning files
- [x] Created comprehensive master plan with legal compliance section
- [x] Merged changes to `feature/consolidate-planning-docs` branch

### ✅ **2. Environment Setup**
- [x] Installed Node.js (v16.20.2) on Rocky Linux 9
- [x] Created `scripts/` directory
- [x] Created `scripts/run-import.sh` runner script
- [x] Created `scripts/import-to-github.js` import script

### ✅ **3. Script Development**
- [x] Fixed `fetch` not defined error (replaced with Node.js https module)
- [x] Added proper error handling for GitHub API calls
- [x] Implemented rate limiting (1 second between requests)
- [x] Added comprehensive parsing of `MASTER_PLAN.md`

## �� **Current Blocking Issue**

### **GitHub Token Permissions Error**
```
❌ Error: Failed to create issue: GitHub API error: 403 - {"message":"Resource not accessible by personal access token"}
```

**Status**: Token needs proper permissions for repository issues

## 📋 **Next Steps Required**

### **Step 1: Create New GitHub Token**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Set permissions:
   - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ **issues** (Full control of issues)
   - ✅ **workflow** (Update GitHub Action workflows)
4. Set expiration: "No expiration" or 90 days
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the new token

### **Step 2: Update Script with New Token**
```javascript
// In scripts/import-to-github.js, update this line:
const GITHUB_TOKEN = 'YOUR_NEW_TOKEN_HERE';
```

### **Step 3: Test Token**
```bash
# Test the new token
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_NEW_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
     https://api.github.com/user
```

### **Step 4: Run Import**
```bash
# Run the import script
node scripts/import-to-github.js
```

### **Step 5: Verify Linear Sync**
1. Check GitHub repository for created issues
2. Verify Linear automatically syncs the issues
3. Organize issues in Linear by phase/priority

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Script Features**
- ✅ Parses `roadmap/MASTER_PLAN.md` for `- [ ]` items
- ✅ Categorizes by phase (1-4)
- ✅ Sets appropriate labels (phase-1, critical, lootfactory, etc.)
- ✅ Uses templates for consistent formatting
- ✅ Handles rate limiting to avoid GitHub API limits
- ✅ Provides summary of created issues

### **Expected Output**
- **99 issues** from MASTER_PLAN.md
- **Organized by phase**: Phase 1 (Critical), Phase 2 (External Integrations), etc.
- **Proper labels**: phase-1, critical, lootfactory, etc.
- **Consistent formatting**: Template-based issue bodies

##  **Ongoing Workflow**

### **Once Set Up:**
1. **GitHub Issues** = Single source of truth
2. **Linear automatically syncs** with GitHub Issues
3. **Update issues** in GitHub, Linear stays in sync
4. **No manual sync** required
5. **Professional workflow** that scales

### **Maintenance:**
- Create new issues in GitHub
- Linear automatically imports them
- Update issue status in Linear
- Changes reflect in GitHub automatically

## 📁 **File Structure**
```
DMDashboard/
├── roadmap/
│   ├── MASTER_PLAN.md              # ✅ Consolidated master plan
│   ├── merge_plan.md               # ✅ Technical consolidation plan
│   └── linear/
│       └── linear_guide.md         # ✅ Linear setup guide
├── scripts/
│   ├── import-to-github.js         # ✅ GitHub import script
│   └── run-import.sh               # ✅ Runner script
└── SETUP_PROGRESS.md               # ✅ This file
```

This documents everything we've done and what needs to be completed next. The key is getting the GitHub token with the right permissions to create repository issues, then Linear will handle the rest automatically!

##  **Success Criteria**
- [ ] GitHub token with proper permissions
- [ ] Script successfully creates 99 issues
- [ ] Linear automatically syncs with GitHub
- [ ] Issues organized by phase/priority
- [ ] Professional workflow established

##  **Next Session**
1. Create new GitHub token with proper permissions
2. Update script with new token
3. Run import and verify Linear sync
4. Begin development workflow with Linear MCP
