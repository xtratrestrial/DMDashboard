## 🎯 Recommended Starting Points

### Phase 1 Critical Items:

## 🔍 Why Manual Addition is Required

GitHub Projects (beta) API has limitations:
- ❌ No API to automatically add issues to project boards
- ❌ No bulk import functionality
- ✅ Issues must be added manually via the UI
- ✅ This is a known limitation of the new Projects API

## 📈 Next Steps After Adding Issues

1. **Set up project views** by Phase, Priority, and Effort
2. **Create milestones** for each development phase
3. **Assign issues** to team members (if applicable)
4. **Set up automation** for issue updates
5. **Track progress** using the project metrics
