- want it to be accessible via the token layer menu https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/foundry.canvas.layers.TokenLayer.html
  - add a menu item in the token layer controls

      - https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/wiki/Active-Effect-Guide
    - Speed

    -
  - Tab 2: loot transfer - get info on item piles module to supplement
  - Tab 3: Marching Order: A grid where players can place their tokens in the order they want to move.
  - Tab 4: Inventory - each character's inventory. Each PC should be collapsable.
    - there should be a section for unclaimed items where everyone can pull items from loot piles onto character token/portraits.
    - button to auto distribute money to the party.
  - Tab 5: Party Magic Item & Wealth tracker: SHould pull info from the actor sheet of each character and organize by rarity based on the guidelines, also showing which item and who it is owned by.
    - it should also add up total party wealth and compare to the game rules.
