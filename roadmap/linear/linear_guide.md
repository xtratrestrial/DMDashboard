## Professional Development Workflow

### Why Linear is Great for Solo Developers

**Linear's free tier** is excellent for solo developers:
- **Unlimited issues** and projects
- **All core features** included
- **GitHub integration** works perfectly
- **No time limits** on the free tier
- **Professional-grade** features that scale

### Professional Development Workflow

Here's how experienced developers typically structure their workflow:

#### 1. **Issue-Driven Development**
```
Feature Request → Linear Issue → Feature Branch → PR → Review → Merge
```

#### 2. **Issue Types & Workflow**
- **Feature**: New functionality
- **Bug**: Something broken
- **Improvement**: Enhance existing features
- **Task**: General work items
- **Documentation**: Docs, README updates

#### 3. **Branch Naming Convention**
```
feature/issue-123-add-user-authentication
bugfix/issue-456-fix-login-error
improvement/issue-789-optimize-database-queries
```

#### 4. **Commit Message Convention**
```
feat: add user authentication (#123)
fix: resolve login error (#456)
docs: update API documentation (#789)
```

## Setting Up Linear for DMDashboard

### Step 1: Create Linear Account
1. Go to [linear.app](https://linear.app)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account (recommended)
3. Create a new organization for your DMDashboard project

### Step 2: Configure Linear for D&D Development
You'll want to set up:
- **Projects**: Separate projects for each tool (LootFactory, name-generator, etc.)
- **Labels**: D&D-specific labels like `dnd-mechanics`, `ui/ux`, `backend`, `frontend`
- **Workflow**: Custom workflow for your development process

### Step 3: GitHub Integration
Linear will automatically:
- Link issues to GitHub PRs
- Show commit history in issues
- Sync with GitHub Issues (if you want)

## Professional Development Best Practices

### 1. Issue Templates
Create templates for:
- **Feature requests** with acceptance criteria
- **Bug reports** with reproduction steps
- **Technical debt** items
- **Documentation** updates

### 2. Sprint Planning
- Use Linear's roadmap feature
- Plan 1-2 week sprints
- Prioritize issues by impact/effort

### 3. Code Review Process
- Link PRs to Linear issues
- Use Linear's PR integration
- Track review status in Linear

## D&D-Specific Development Guidelines

### SRD Compliance
- Always reference `2024SRD.txt` for D&D rules
- Ensure all mechanics comply with official SRD
- Validate spell descriptions, monster stats, magic items
- Use SRD as authoritative source for terminology

### D&D Feature Development
- **Spell Systems**: Reference SRD spell descriptions
- **Monster Creation**: Follow SRD monster stat blocks
- **Magic Items**: Use SRD item descriptions
- **Combat Mechanics**: Implement SRD combat rules
- **Character Creation**: Follow SRD character rules

### Testing D&D Features
- Test against SRD rules
- Validate mathematical accuracy
- Ensure balance compliance
- Test edge cases in D&D mechanics

## MCP Integration Setup

### Prerequisites
- Linear account and organization set up
- Node.js installed on your system
- Cursor IDE configured

### Installation Steps
1. Install Linear MCP server:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-linear
   ```

2. Configure MCP server with Linear API key

3. Set up Cursor to use Linear MCP

4. Test integration with sample issues

### MCP Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear"],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment Options

### 1. Linear Cloud (Recommended)
- Use Linear's hosted service at [linear.app](https://linear.app)
- No server setup required
- Accessible from anywhere
- Free tier available for small teams
- Automatic updates and maintenance

### 2. Cloud Server Deployment
- Self-host Linear (if available)
- More control but requires maintenance
- Need to handle updates, backups, security

### 3. Hybrid Approach
- Use Linear Cloud for the main service
- Set up MCP server on your cloud server for Cursor integration
- Best of both worlds: reliable service + custom integration

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Linear account** and organization
2. **Configure projects** for each DMDashboard tool
3. **Create issue templates** for your workflow
4. **Set up GitHub integration**
5. **Install and configure MCP server**
6. **Test the complete workflow**
