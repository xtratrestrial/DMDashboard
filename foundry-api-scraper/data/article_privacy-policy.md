## The Foundry Virtual Tabletop Software

If you purchase and use the Foundry Virtual Tabletop software, you will be prompted to agree to our End User License Agreement. When you agree to this EULA your software license key is signed by our website. As part of that process we record the IP address of the host machine where you activated the Foundry Virtual Tabletop software.

The Foundry Virtual Tabletop software stores your software license key - which is not personally identifiable - and uses this software license key to periodically check with this website to verify your access and check for available software updates.

As a user of Foundry Virtual Tabletop you may enable an optional setting to Share Usage Data which shares additional data with us that helps us to improve Foundry Virtual Tabletop. This data helps us to answer questions like "which Foundry Virtual Tabletop software versions are most widely used?", "which Game Systems are most frequently played?", and "how many of our users host on macOS compared to Linux?".

The usage data collected by the software does not contain any personally identifying information and is not shared directly with any other party. For transparency, the Foundry Virtual Tabletop software saves the usage data it collects in your user data folder in the Logs/diagnostics.json file. Below is presented a real example of the usage data the software collects. This collected data is only shared with us if the Share Usage Data setting is enabled. This setting is initially disabled and can be re-disabled at any point after it has been enabled.
