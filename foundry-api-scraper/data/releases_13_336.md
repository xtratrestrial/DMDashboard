# Release 13.336


## Version 13 Testing


##### February 13, 2025


## Foundry Virtual Tabletop - Version 13 - Testing 1 Release Notes

We are very pleased to announce and share the release of Foundry Virtual Tabletop Version 13 Testing 1 (Build 336), our first release of the Testing Phase for Version 13.

As part of the Testing phase, this update is less focused on new features and more focused on delivering bug fixes and stability to the many new things and Application V2 conversions that we've implemented so far as part of the V13 update cycle.

WARNING:  This Testing update is intended for those dedicated users who wish to test the new features provided in Version 13. It is not intended for use in weekly games or in games with heavy use of add-on modules. The goal for this build is to collect preliminary testing feedback from developers and users, not to power actual game sessions!


## Ember Alpha One and This Release

The V13 Testing 1 update is especially exciting for us because it marks a major milestone for our Ember project. This build is intended to support the (very rapidly)  upcoming Alpha 1 release release of Ember, which is currently anticipated to happen at some point tomorrow!

Like all Testing releases, V13 Testing 1 is not intended for use in live games except if you are one of our wonderful Ember Alpha backers and you are willing to help put yourself and your players on the testing front lines. Even in this special circumstance, please remember that this is a Testing build, and bugs should be fully expected.

Whether or not you are an Ember Alpha 1 supporter, we'd like to send a huge thank-you to everyone helping us test V13. We appreciate your support, enthusiasm, and patience!

As always, it is very important to back up your user data before any major update. It is strongly recommended to backup your important Worlds before experimenting with the Testing Build. Better yet, consider taking a full Snapshot.


## Breaking Changes


### Architecture and Infrastructure

- Implemented significant changes to CONSTs regarding media, categories, and file extensions, including a type change and some deprecations. Additionally, .webm video files can now be uploaded in video file pickers, but .webm audio files are no longer accepted in audio file pickers. (10814)

`CONST``.webm``.webm`
### Documents and Data

- When changing the type of a Document, the system field must now be either force-replaced (==system: ...) or updated with recursive: false in the same update that changes the type. (11951)

`type``system``==system: ...``recursive: false``type`
## New Features


### Documents and Data

- Removed the 0.5 step size restriction from Token width and height. (12078)
- Changed the flags field to TypedObjectField(ObjectField). (12145)

`flags``TypedObjectField(ObjectField)`
### Applications and User Interface

- Leading spaces in text search (PossibleMatchesTooltip) are now ignored. (11669)
- Set default ApplicationV2 window width and height to "auto". (12130)

`PossibleMatchesTooltip``ApplicationV2`
### The Game Canvas

- The token is now force-teleported if its x, y, elevation, width, height, or shape is changed through the Token config. Previously, the token was treated as if it moved to the new position. (12159)

`x``y``elevation``width``height``shape`
### Other Changes

- Updated minimum required browser versions. New minimum versions: Electron 33, Chromium 122, and Firefox 127. (12110)

### Other Changes

- Added hooks for DocumentDirectory#_getEntryContextOptions and DocumentDirectory#_getFolderContextOptions, allowing modules to extend those menus. (11985)

`DocumentDirectory#_getEntryContextOptions``DocumentDirectory#_getFolderContextOptions`
## Bug Fixes


### Documents and Data

- Document._addDataFieldMigration does not delete old property if nested. (11148)
- Added a safeguard so that the type of TypedSchemaField cannot be changed unless the entire field value is force-replaced (==) or the update is non-recursive (recursive: false). (11864)
- Types are now added before DataModel.migrateData is called so that the current type of TypedSchemaFields is always known, even if they weren't changed in an update. (11866)
- Resolved an issue where flags.core.sourceId was not consistently migrated to _stats.compendiumSource. (11958)
- Resolved an issue where StringField that were configured with choices of type {[choice: string]: {label: string}} were no longer using the provided labels for the generated input element. (12053)
- Resolved an issue where TypedSchemaField#_updateDiff incorrectly used the schema of the old type instead of the new type when type was changed. (12082)
- Prevented a situation where DataModel.LOCALIZATION_PREFIXES could cross-contaminate across multiple models. (12117)
- Updated Roll#toMessage and RollTable#toMessage to properly refer to author instead of user. (12126)
- Resolved an issue where updating DataModel with recursive: false was no longer functioning as intended. (12133)
- Deleting (-=) a required field of a SchemaField now properly throws a validation error. (12135)
