# Dungeons & Dragons Arrives on Foundry VTT


## 

Updated January 30, 2024

We are thrilled to share that Foundry Virtual Tabletop is now partnered with Wizards of the Coast to bring official content for Dungeons & Dragons to Foundry VTT!

A lot of hard work and persistence from our team as well as from the team at Wizards of the Coast went into making this partnership happen, and we are excited to work together to build a modern, innovative, and powerful toolset for playing D&D online. The capabilities of Foundry VTT combine with the iconic stories and settings of Dungeons & Dragons to create a super-powered, immersive, and engaging role-playing experience that we are confident you will love.

We are kicking off our partnership with two major releases: a huge update to the now-official Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition game system, and Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk, an epic and iconic introduction to Dungeons & Dragons which expands a beloved starter adventure into a sprawling campaign for character levels 1 through 12. This update to the D&D fifth edition game system is available now and Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk will be available for purchase on February 1, 2024!


## D&D Fifth Edition Game System Update

An essential objective with this partnership was to imbue our D&D game system on Foundry VTT with the quality, style, and iconic feel of Dungeons & Dragons. The system version 3.0 release is a huge step for us towards accomplishing those goals and makes playing D&D on Foundry Virtual Tabletop better than ever. The D&D system update includes the following major features:


##### Reimagined Character Sheet

A beautiful, intuitive, and functional new character sheet provides a wonderful experience for creating, managing, and role-playing your character. This sheet features an entirely new design, improved organization, beautiful and informative tooltips, and way more.


##### Gather the Party

It is now possible to designate a particular Group actor as the "Party" and add your player's characters to it. Having your player characters grouped up in a Party enables effortless automation of experience, currency, and loot distribution as well as DM-friendly automation for skill checks and saving throws. For example, hovering over any passive skill check will show you who in the party passes or fails the DC.


##### Item Containers

You can create Container items which allow you to bundle other items and currency together. Using containers allows for superior inventory management, easier loot distribution, clever shopkeeping, and more.


##### Requested Rolls

A new roll syntax allows the DM to easily request for players to make Ability, Saving Throw, or Tool checks against a configured DC. You can also easily test your Party's effectiveness against passive checks which summarize the group members who meet or exceed a passive check DC.


##### Ruletips

References to game rules like status effect conditions, terrain types, and cover mechanics now expand into elegant and helpful tooltips that make rules questions easy to resolve. These "ruletips" are supported both on our new character sheet as well as in Journal Entries whenever such rules are mentioned. Spend less time wondering what "three-quarters cover" means and more time focusing on the story!


##### Dynamic Token Engine

The updated system includes a new rendering engine for official D&D creature and NPC tokens which will be provided by premium content modules. These official tokens are rendered using dynamic composition which allows for the token ring, background, and creature artwork to be addressed with special effects or UX prompts. For example, a visual indication is displayed on the token ring when a creature takes damage or receives healing.


##### Expanded Automation

This release develops and strengthens the foundation for roll automation, allowing us to provide more automated guidance for roll outcomes and paving the way for future updates with features like automatic resistance and vulnerability application, expanded use of Active Effects, and automated damage application workflows.

In addition to these amazing features which are available now, we have written more about our upcoming roadmap and development plans for the official Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition game system so you can know what to expect over the coming months!

## Frequently Asked Questions

Our partnership with Wizards of the Coast is for previous and future fifth edition releases, including those following the release of the 2024 core rulebooks!

Our plans are for the existing dnd5e system to evolve and upgrade to become the system used for the upcoming release of the 2024 core rulebooks once they are available. Older versions of the game system will remain available for users who aren't yet ready to upgrade.

`dnd5e`Normally we would have started with these products, but given the expected release window for the updated core rulebooks (later in 2024) we felt it would be the wrong call to develop and sell those premium modules when a new range of products designed using the 2024 core rulebooks are coming just around the corner. We will be working closely with our partners at Wizards of the Coast to support the core rulebook sources as soon as possible while continuing to work on other releases throughout the year!

We aren't ready to announce what the next official D&D release on Foundry VTT will be, but you should expect another product to be available soon. As mentioned in the previous question we will also be releasing core rulebook sources later in the year as soon as it's possible to do so.

Not at this time. Our focus for the moment is on adding amazing features and content for D&D fifth edition. We will work with Wizards of the Coast to evaluate the opportunity for legacy content for older editions, but there are no plans to pursue development of such content at this time.

At this time, there are no changes to the DMs Guild policy on supported VTTs, but we will be working with our partners at Wizards of the Coast and DriveThruRPG to assess whether it is feasible to change that.

No, the Foundry Virtual Tabletop editions of this premium D&D fifth edition content are not interchangeable with the digital books purchased on D&D Beyond.

Unfortunately that is not something we can offer. Our team incurs the cost of developing and optimizing this content specifically for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, so the Foundry VTT version of a product is not interchangeable with versions purchased elsewhere.

We are proud of the level of quality imbued in Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk and we think you will love it!
