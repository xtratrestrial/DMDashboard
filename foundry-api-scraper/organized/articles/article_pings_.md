# Pings


## 


## Overview

Pings are visual guides used to point out, highlight or alert other users. Gamemasters can also use pings to reposition player cameras to view specific parts of a canvas.

All pings are created by long left-click of the mouse on the game canvas while using any of the Token Control ( ) tools.

For more on token controls and how to use them, see the Tokens article.


#### Basic Ping

The most basic ping creates a pulsing circle under your cursor using your selected user color. Any users on the scene with you will see the ping, and any users on the scene with you but not looking at the same part of the canvas will see a pulsing arrow along the edge of the UI indicating the direction of the ping.

Basic Pings are created by pressing and holding Left Click on the canvas.


#### Warning Ping

The warning ping creates a pulsing red triangle under your cursor. Any users on the scene with you will see the ping, and any users on the scene with you but not looking at the same part of the canvas will see a pulsing arrow along the edge of the UI indicating the direction of the ping.

Warning Pings are created by pressing and holding Alt + Left Click on the canvas.


#### Drag Pings

The drag view ping creates a circle on the canvas followed by a downward pointing arrow, both using your selected user color. In addition to this, all users on that scene have their cameras moved to center on the ping location. This ping function is limited to gamemaster and assistant game master users only.

Drag Pings are created by pressing and holding Shift + Left Click on the canvas.
