# Terms and Conditions of Sale


## 


##### Updated June 21, 2024

The following terms and conditions apply when purchasing premium content from the Foundry Virtual Tabletop store. If you have any questions or concerns about these terms please Contact Us for more information.


## 1. Payments


### 1a. Terms of Purchase

Foundry Virtual Tabletop uses Stripe as a third-party payment processor to manage, authenticate, and process payment for purchases on this website. Please read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of Stripe for further details. When making a purchase you agree to provide Stripe with accurate billing information and payment method details and to pay all fees and applicable taxes.


### 1b. Payment Methods

Stripe supports payment via major international credit cards. In the EU several bank transfer methods are supported: Bancontact, EPS, giropay, iDeal, Przelewy24, and SEPA Debit. Stripe also supports Google Pay, Apple Pay, and AliPay for customers in some geographies.

Payments processed via SEPA Direct Debit will take extra time to process. Due to the time it takes banks to communicate this information to one another, payments can take up to 10 business days to process. There are two steps to the SEPA Debit workflow, in the first step Stripe submits a mandate to your bank which enacts the debit request. In the second phase the bank reports back to Stripe once the debit request has cleared. As a result, the charge may appear on your bank account 1-3 days before the purchase is fully completed. Please remain patient, and you will receive an email containing your issued license key information as soon as the successful charge is reported back to the Stripe platform.


### 1c. Sales Tax

Foundry Gaming LLC is a limited liability corporation registered in the State of Washington and is required to collect sales tax on software sold to customers in the State of Washington or in other US states where the number of Foundry Virtual Tabletop license sales exceed a minimum threshold to require sales tax collection.

We also collect sales tax (VAT) in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Australia.

If you believe you are being charged an incorrect amount of sales tax please Contact Us with your concerns and we will do our best to address them.


## 2. Returns and Refunds
