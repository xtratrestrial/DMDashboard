# Anniversary Celebration 2025


## 

This May we're celebrating the fifth anniversary of the release of Foundry Virtual Tabletop in 2020. We love being able to take the time to look back and take stock of just how far things have come and how much has changed, for the Foundry VTT software and for us as a company. We're very happy to be able to mark this special occasion with special events, behind-the-curtain peeks at our projects, and of course, our anniversary sale. We hope everyone in the community will join us in marking this milestone and that our scheduled events offer a little something for everyone.


## Sales and Special Offers

As is tradition, for the period of our anniversary celebration we're offering a discount on first-party Foundry VTT products!

Foundry Virtual Tabletop software licenses are discounted at 20% off from noon eastern time on May 21 until 6pm eastern time on May 31. This discount is applied automatically when you purchase.

We also are offering 20% off our first-party content The Demon Queen Awakens and A House Divided over the same time period.


#### Official Marketplace

Earlier this year we launched our Official Marketplace, serving as a single point of purchase for premium content packages from a wide variety of creators and supporting a large number of game systems. Having a more unified storefront affords us a nice opportunity to work with our partners in the content creator community to offer sales on an even bigger variety of products than ever before!


#### Other Sales

Several other premium content partners are running concurrent sales to help us mark the big occasion!

- Cubicle 7 - 20% off select Foundry VTT modules
- Hod Studio - 20-30% off select Foundry VTT modules


## Event Schedule

In addition to being able to snag some amazing premium content, we have a number of exciting events to look forward to over the period.


### Version 14 Patreon Feature Vote

Thursday, May 22 - On Patreon

With Version 13 Stable now firmly in community hands, we've already begun figuring out what we'll do in V14. While the planning stage for a new version always takes some time and we're not intending to launch immediately into development for V14, one thing we always take the time to do is poll our community for which major feature we should prioritize this version.

We will post an article outlining what concepts we have for the community to vote on this time around, and simultaneously the poll will be made available to our community members who support us on Patreon so that their votes can be counted for which feature we will prioritize alongside our other planned changes for V14. As always, the listed features on these votes tend to change each Version, with some returning and others disappearing for a short time, so if your favorite feature from the last poll is missing, don't worry! It may return for the next one.

Details of the available options for the feature vote can be found on our V14 Feature Vote Article.


### Livestream: Unboxing V13

2PM EDT, Friday, May 23  - On Twitch

Since Version 13 development is now settling into a maintenance cycle, we think it's a good time to take a look back at the development of Version 13. We hope you'll join us as we walk through the battery of features and changes that we've made since V12, and reminisce about the development process, the back-and-forth discussion, and the challenges we faced while working on V13.


### PaizoCon Livestream: Foundry VTT Digital Content Preview

1PM EDT, Saturday, May 24 - On Twitch

We have been invited to send a rugged band of emissaries to PaizoCon so that they can showcase some upcoming first-party content our team has been working on for Golarion.

Please join Cora and select members of the Pathfinder Second Edition volunteer system development team as they jump in with Paizo Digital Product Lead Andrew White to show off why Foundry VTT is the true home of Pathfinder Second Edition and maybe, just maybe, share some exciting news.


### Livestream: Ember Worldbuilding - Ordain and the Bloodwoods

2PM EDT, Sunday, May 25 - On Twitch

Join Caeora and Atropos (and maybe some of the other Ember team members) for a relaxed discussion about the work that goes into worldbuilding for Ember. We hope you'll all join us for a discussion of the setting as a whole while Caeora works on some maps for the forthcoming game.


### Article: Year in Review Fifth Anniversary Edition

Monday, May 26

Each year as part of our anniversary celebration we write a comprehensive "year in review" article where we take the time to reflect on what we've accomplished during the previous 12 months. This article is perhaps one of the most important pieces of writing to us as a team and a company because it gives us a much needed break and allows us to take the time to look back on all that we have achieved and how far we've come, while turning a hopeful eye to future planning. If this is the first year in review article you've read, it's a great way to get some insight into exactly what we do as a team and how we do it. If you would like to read prior versions of this article you can find them here:

- Year in Review: One-Year Anniversary Edition
- Year in Review: Two-Year Anniversary Edition
- Year in Review: Three-Year Anniversary Edition
- Year in Review: Four-Year Anniversary Edition

Now that it is published, the newest installment of this "Year in Review" series is available for your reading at Year in Review: Five-Year Anniversary Edition!


### Livestream: Let's Die (Tomb of Annihilation)

1PM-ðŸ’€ EDT, Tuesday, May 27 On Twitch

Brutal. Unforgiving. Punishing. Fun.  Atropos and members of our core software, content creation, and Ember teams have elected to throw caution to the wind and sacrifice their own sanity by diving into the Tomb of Annihilation on a livestream designed for your entertainment. Come and watch as they suffer through extreme encounters and speculate on the funniest and most dramatic ways their characters may die.


### r/FoundryVTT: "Ask Us Anything"

Wednesday, May 28 - On Reddit

We recognize that our unofficial Reddit community on r/foundryvtt is a second home for our users, and this will mark the fifth year that we've hosted an AMA there. We love being able to engage with the community and share personal stories and insights into Foundry VTT.

We will be answering your questions throughout the day in a thread which will be posted a few hours before the time window opens in order to really get the most out of the discussion for our international community. We look forward to a mix of hard-hitting and silly questions that allow us to share perspective with you, but we ask that any tech support questions be kept to our community discord instead.


### Livestream: Free Project Friday LIVE

12PM EDT, Friday, May 30 - On Twitch

The Foundry VTT team has a monthly tradition of "Free Project Friday". Usually this is a behind-closed-doors opportunity for our team to work creatively on projects that are of personal interest to us, but this month we will be sharing our process with everyone!

Each month we allow ourselves a day (more or less) to explore and develop projects which are related to Foundry Virtual Tabletop but are things that we otherwise wouldn't have time or prioritization to work on. Many of these Free Project Friday (or "FPF") contributions become new features in the core software while others never make it past the planning stage - regardless it is always a fun and creative time and our team is excited to share with you live on twitch.tv/foundryvtt.


### Livestream: Ember Development - Ordain and Beyond

1PM EDT, Saturday, May 31 - On Twitch

Closing out the anniversary celebration, Join Atropos and the Ember team for an in-depth look at the current state of development for Ember and get an update on the progress being made in the ever-advancing march toward Ember's release. Join us for an exciting look at what's to come!
