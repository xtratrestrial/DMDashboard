# Release 13.346


## Version 13 Stable


##### June 26, 2025


## Foundry Virtual Tabletop - Version 13 - Stable 5 Release Notes

Since the arrival of Version 13 Stable in late April, we've released a steady series of minor patches to help refine it. In that vein, Version 13 Stable 5 contains a collection of important but relatively undramatic improvements and bugfixes.

Notably, we anticipate that today's release will be the last (or one of the last) of these "patch" releases. As proud as we are of Version 13, we are extremely eager to turn our full attention to the next major generation of Foundry VTT.

Both the Patreon poll winner (core "pop out" application windows) and "Scene Levels" (enhanced verticality for Scenes) are features that have long been eagerly anticipated by Foundry VTT staff and users alike. With work starting in earnest on Version 14 soon, these features begin to become reality. Stay tuned!

WARNING: While this is categorized as a stable release there is always a possibility of unexpected bugs or compatibility issues. As with any time you update the core software, be sure to perform a complete backup of your user data to minimize any risk of data loss.

While this release makes modest changes, there are two items that we would like to call some additional attention to.
