##### April 28, 2023


## Foundry Virtual Tabletop - Version 11 - Testing 1 Release Notes

WARNING: Be certain to carefully back up any critical user data before installing this update.

We are excited to announce the beginning of our Feature Testing phase with the release of Foundry Virtual Tabletop Version 11 Testing 1. As we shift our focus from API development to more user-facing features, we look forward to seeing more users checking out some of the great things we've been working on! All through Version 11 we have been working toward the goal of improving the user experience on our setup screen, offering improved compendium functionality by updating our database engine and providing a new level of organization through compendium folders, completely overhauling how synthetic actors work, and a whole new tier of canvas-focused changes bringing overall improved performance.

WARNING: Releases on the Testing channel have the potential to introduce bugs that may be disruptive to play. These features are close to a stable release - but likely to still include some bugs and incompatibilities which may frustrate you. While these releases are intended for testing by the average user, we do not recommend you use them yet in your long running campaigns. We instead ask you try them out in a new World or one-shot with no modules.


## Update Highlights

As is often the case with updates on our Testing channel, this release focuses primarily on refining features we developed in V11. We've improved the user experience or interface in a variety of ways, while simultaneously ironing out bugs found during earlier releases. These are just some of the cool features we want to highlight in Version 11 Testing 1:


### Journal to Table

Since we moved to ProseMirror as our primary rich text editor in Version 10 we've received a lot of feedback about the need for a GUI-based way for users to add tables to their journals. We heard you, and Kim took the time during this version to re-introduce support for managing tables within your journal entries via ProseMirror.


### This Just In, Favorites Enabled!

Continuing the series of improvements for the setup screen, we've connected the initial stages of our News Feed and Featured Content displays to our website backend. While these are a simple shorthand rotation for now to just test that the display works, you can look forward to a more curated list in the future! We look forward to being able to highlight new events within the community, news about the company, development progress and more to our audience outside of discord.

In addition, we've taken some pretty great feedback about the user experience of the setup screen and have added the capability for users to mark certain worlds, modules, or systems as Favorites. Favorite packages will be displayed at the top of the menu for each package type, allowing users quick access to worlds they often launch, or packages they often update!


### Compendium Pack Completionist

As we get closer and closer to a release on the Stable channel, we've been working hard to refine our reimagining of the compendium sidebar and compendium packs as a whole. It's now possible to set compendiums to a new "manual" sort mode, allowing users to reorganize their in-game compendium packs as they see fit. In addition, developers will be pleased to know they can now define default compendium folders in the manifest files for their packages, allowing for more out-of-game organization! We've also taken some steps to improve the compendium sidebar UI for readability.


### Programming Pesticide

It's impossible to implement cool new features to any software without introducing the occasional bug. Thanks to the dilligent efforts of our community developers and brave users we have been receiving a steady stream of bug reports in all areas of the software, so our dev team has been fighting the bugs with fervor! Don't worry, the devs took the time to don their customary personal protective equipmentâ€” full hazmat suits, gloves, respirators and all.


## Known Issues

Our initial implementation of the news section may initially display an error message indicating that "No content recommendations were received from the foundryvtt.com webserver". This seems to primarily occur on first launch, but is resolved after further launches. We are aware of this issue and will refine this experience in the next release.
