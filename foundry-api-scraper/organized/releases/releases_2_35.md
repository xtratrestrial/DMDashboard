## Beta 0.2.0 Release Notes

The Beta 0.2.0 release of Foundry Virtual Tabletop is a bit unusual in that it does not represent a significant update in features from the Alpha
0.1.7 build distributed recently. This particular update is more of a re-basing of the versioning system to use minor version 0.2 moving forward for Beta testing.
