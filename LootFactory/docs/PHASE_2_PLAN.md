# Phase 2 Implementation Plan

Based on your feedback, here's our confirmed implementation:

## âœ… Approved Systems:
1. **Spell Scroll Subsystem** - Auto-determine levels, random spell selection
2. **CR/Level-Based Selection** - OH YES! Play tier integration
3. **Individual vs Hoard Modes** - Separate algorithms for different treasure types
4. **Enspelled Item Customization** - Auto-determine weapon/armor types
5. **Giant Strength Potion Tiers** - Play tier weighted probabilities
6. **Variant Selection** - Auto-selection for complex items (figurines, etc.)

## Next Steps:
- Re-add Xanathar's Guide content
- Begin Phase 2 core engine development
- Implement all approved subsystems

Timeline: 4 weeks for complete generation engine
