Magic

Magic functions on the Astral Plane as it does in most other D&D settings. The following sections present spells and magic items that are popular among astral travelers.
Spells

The Spells table lists the two spells in this section and the levels of those spells. The table also notes the school of magic of a spell and which classes have access to it. (The artificer class is presented in Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything.)
Spells
Level 	Spell 	School 	Class
2nd 	Air Bubble 	Conjuration 	Artificer, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard
5th 	Create Spelljamming Helm 	Transmutation 	Artificer, Wizard
Air Bubble Spell
Air Bubble

2nd-Level Conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 feet

Components: S

Duration: 24 hours

You create a spectral globe around the head of a willing creature you can see within range. The globe is filled with fresh air that lasts until the spell ends. If the creature has more than one head, the globe of air appears around only one of its heads (which is all the creature needs to avoid suffocation, assuming that all its heads share the same respiratory system).

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create two additional globes of fresh air for each slot level above 2nd.
Create Spelljamming Helm

5th-Level Transmutation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M (a crystal rod worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

Duration: Instantaneous

Holding the rod used in the casting of the spell, you touch a Large or smaller chair that is unoccupied. The rod disappears, and the chair is transformed into a spelljamming helm (see “Magic Items” below).
Magic Items

This section describes magic items that are essential to travel and survival in Wildspace, as well as other items likely to be found on the Astral Plane.
Fish Suit

Wondrous Item, Very Rare

This bulky suit, which fully encases your head and body, takes 1 minute to don or doff. While worn, it enables you to breathe in an airless environment and renders you immune to the harmful effects of any gas that surrounds you. The suit also grants you a swimming speed equal to your walking speed while underwater, or a flying speed equal to your walking speed in an environment with no gravity.
Spelljamming Helm

Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)

The function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a ship on which it has been installed through space and air. It can also propel and maneuver a ship on water or underwater, provided the ship is built for such travel. The ship in question must weigh 1 ton or more.
Three Examples of a Spelljamming Helm

The sensation of being attuned to a spelljamming helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one’s arm or leg falls asleep, but not as painful.

While attuned to a spelljamming helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):

    You can use the spelljamming helm to move the ship through space, air, or water up to the ship’s speed. If the ship is in space and no other objects weighing 1 ton or more are within 1 mile of it, you can use the spelljamming helm to move the vessel fast enough to travel 100 million miles in 24 hours.
    You can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.
    At any time, you can see and hear what’s happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it.

Transfer Attunement. You can use an action to touch a willing spellcaster. That creature attunes to the spelljamming helm immediately, and your attunement to it ends.

COST OF A SPELLJAMMING HELM

A spelljamming helm propels and steers a ship much as sails, oars, and rudders work on a seafaring vessel, and a spelljamming helm is easy to create if one has the proper spell. Create spelljamming helm (see the spell’s description) has a material component cost of 5,000 gp, so that’s the least one can pay to acquire a spelljamming helm.

Wildspace merchants, including dohwars and mercanes (both described in Boo’s Astral Menagerie), typically sell a spelljamming helm for substantially more than it cost to make. How much more depends on the market, but 7,500 gp would be a reasonable demand. A desperate buyer in a seller’s market might pay 10,000 gp or more.
Wildspace Orrery

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

Inside a Wildspace system, this portable arcane device automatically tracks the positions and movements of all suns, planets, moons, and comets within that system, projecting a display of all these bodies in the space above its current location. In that display, a white, pulsating pinprick of light marks the orrery’s location.
