Magic

Magic on the planes largely functions as it does in other D&D settings, though some exceptions exist in Sigil (see chapter 2). The following sections present spells and magic items the DM can provide for planar travelers.
Spells

The Spells table shows which classes can cast the spells in this section and the levels of those spells. The table also notes the school of magic of each spell.
Spells
Level 	Spell 	School 	Class
2nd 	Warp sense 	Divination 	Sorcerer, warlock, wizard
4th 	Gate seal 	Abjuration 	Sorcerer, warlock, wizard
Gate Seal

4th-Level Abjuration

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 60 feet

Components: V, S, M (a broken portal key, which the spell consumes)

Duration: 24 hours

You fortify the fabric of the planes in a 30-foot cube you can see within range. Within that area, portals close and can’t be opened for the duration. Spells and other effects that allow planar travel or open portals, such as gate or plane shift, fail if used to enter or leave the area. The cube is stationary.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled.
Warp Sense

2nd-Level Divination

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (a razorvine leaf)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you sense the presence of portals, even inactive ones, within 30 feet of yourself.

If you detect a portal in this way, you can use your action to study it. Make a DC 15 ability check using your spellcasting ability. On a successful check, you learn the destination plane of the portal and what portal key it requires, then the spell ends. On a failed check, you learn nothing and can’t study that portal again using this spell until you cast it again.

The spell can penetrate most barriers but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
Magic Items

This section describes magic items likely to be found in Sigil and the Outlands.
Mimir

Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)

This skull-shaped device is filled with knowledge. The device weighs 5 pounds and is covered with subtle etchings of planar sigils.

Mimir

As a bonus action, you can toss the device into the air, whereupon it floats at a distance of 1d3 feet from you and you can access its properties. While the mimir is floating, a creature other than you can use an action to grasp or net the device, either by making a successful unarmed strike against AC 22 or a successful DC 22 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use a bonus action to seize and stow the device.

The device has AC 22, 25 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to all other damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it is floating near you.

Esoteric Knowledge. While the device is floating, you can use an action to cast legend lore from the device. The device speaks the revealed lore aloud. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Planar Knowledge. The device knows basic, useful information about the planes of existence. While the device is floating, it verbally answers questions you or anyone you designate poses to it about that topic. It knows the information about the planes in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, as well as basic information about the gate-towns of the Outlands (presented in chapter 3 of this book).
Portal Compass

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This portable arcane instrument points in the direction of the last portal it passed through while it and the portal are on the same plane of existence. If that portal no longer exists, the needle becomes static until the compass passes through a new portal.

Sensory Stone

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This small, smooth stone contains the essence of a single experience.

As an action, you or a willing creature you designate can touch the stone and experience the sensation as if it happened to the designated creature. The illusory experience is fleeting and harmless, however real it might feel in the moment.

Record Sensation. You can use your reaction to record a short sensation lasting no longer than 6 seconds experienced by a creature of your choice within 30 feet of yourself, infusing the essence of that experience into the stone. This replaces any sensation already stored within the stone.

Siphon Sensation. As a bonus action, you can draw on the stone’s magic to end the charmed or frightened condition on yourself, destroying the stone in the process.
