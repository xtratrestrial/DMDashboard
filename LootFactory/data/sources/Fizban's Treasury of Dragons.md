Dragon Magic

The magic woven through the fabric of the Material Plane is concentrated in dragons and their lairs. This chapter is all about the magic of dragons, unfolding in four sections:

“Spells” offers a selection of spells associated with dragons.

“Magic Items” presents several magic items associated with dragons, many connected to the gem dragons introduced in chapter 6.

“Hoard Items” introduces a new kind of magic items, which siphon the magical energy associated with a dragon’s hoard.

“Draconic Gifts” introduces magical gifts that characters might gain in connection with a dragon’s death or other unusual circumstances.

Spells

I am less guarded with my spells than I am with my recipes. Magic shared is soon improved. But when it comes to my pudding, well, you can’t fix perfect.

This section contains new spells that the DM may add to a campaign, making them available to player characters and monster spellcasters alike. The Spells table lists the new spells, ordering them by level. The table also notes the school of magic of a spell, whether it requires concentration, whether it bears the ritual tag, and which classes have access to it.

3rd-Level Transmutation

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: Self

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

The billowing flames of a dragon blast from your feet, granting you explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 20 feet and moving doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

When you move within 5 feet of a creature or an object that isn’t being worn or carried, it takes 1d6 fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or object can take this damage only once during a turn.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase your speed by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 3rd. The spell deals an additional 1d6 fire damage for each slot level above 3rd.
Draconic Transformation

7th-Level Transmutation

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: Self

Components: V, S, M (a statuette of a dragon, worth at least 500 gp)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

With a roar, you draw on the magic of dragons to transform yourself, taking on draconic features. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:

Blindsight. You have blindsight with a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you’re blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

Breath Weapon. When you cast this spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns for the duration, you can exhale shimmering energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Wings. Incorporeal wings sprout from your back, giving you a flying speed of 60 feet.
Fizban’s Platinum Shield

6th-Level Abjuration

Casting Time: 1 bonus action

Range: 60 feet

Components: V, S, M (a platinum-plated dragon scale, worth at least 500 gp)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a field of silvery light that surrounds a creature of your choice within range (you can choose yourself). The field sheds dim light out to 5 feet. While surrounded by the field, a creature gains the following benefits:

Cover. The creature has half cover.

Damage Resistance. The creature has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison damage.

Evasion. If the creature is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the creature instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

As a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the field to another creature within 60 feet of the field.

Scholars have engaged in lengthy debates over whether or not this spell should properly be attributed to me. Honestly, I’ve created so many things, I can’t really keep track of them all.

-Fizban
Nathair’s Mischief

2nd-Level Illusion

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 feet

Components: S, M (a piece of crust from an apple pie)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You fill a 20-foot cube you can see within range with fey and draconic magic. Roll on the Mischievous Surge table to determine the magical effect produced, and roll again at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. You can move the cube up to 10 feet before you roll.
Mischievous Surge
d4 	Effect
1 	The smell of apple pie fills the air, and each creature in the cube must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you until the start of your next turn.
2 	Bouquets of flowers appear all around, and each creature in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the start of your next turn as the flowers spray water in their faces.
3 	Each creature in the cube must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or begin giggling until the start of your next turn. A giggling creature is incapacitated and uses all its movement to move in a random direction.
4 	Drops of molasses hover in the cube, making it difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.
Raulothim’s Psychic Lance

4th-Level Enchantment

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 120 feet

Components: V

Duration: Instantaneous

You unleash a shimmering lance of psychic power from your forehead at a creature that you can see within range. Alternatively, you can utter a creature’s name. If the named target is within range, it becomes the spell’s target even if you can’t see it. If the named target isn’t within range, the lance dissipates without effect.

The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 7d6 psychic damage and is incapacitated until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t incapacitated.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
Rime’s Binding Ice

2nd-Level Evocation

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Self (30-foot cone)

Components: S, M (a vial of meltwater)

Duration: Instantaneous

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 cold damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t hindered by ice.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the cold damage by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

5th-Level Conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 60 feet

Components: V, S, M (an object with the image of a dragon engraved on it, worth at least 500 gp)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a draconic spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Draconic Spirit stat block. When you cast this spell, choose a family of dragon: chromatic, gem, or metallic. The creature resembles a dragon of the chosen family, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell’s level appears in the stat block.

This fist-sized chunk of amethyst is infused with an amethyst dragon’s ability to bend gravitational forces. While you are carrying the lodestone, you have advantage on Strength saving throws.

The lodestone has 6 charges for the following properties, which you can use while you are holding the stone. The stone regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

Crystal Blade

Weapon (Any Sword), Rare (Requires Attunement)

This magic sword’s blade is fashioned from a horn or spine from a crystal dragon. When you hit with an attack roll using this sword, the target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

The sword has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with an attack roll using the sword, you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the extra radiant damage the sword dealt.

While you’re holding the sword, you can use a bonus action to cause it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, to cause it to shed dim light in a 10-foot radius, or to douse the light.
Dragonhide Belt

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2), or Very Rare (+3) (Requires Attunement by a Monk)

This finely detailed belt is made of dragonhide. While wearing it, you gain a bonus to the saving throw DCs of your ki features. The bonus is determined by the belt’s rarity. In addition, you can use an action to regain ki points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die. You can’t use this action again until the next dawn.
Dragonlance

Weapon (Lance or Pike), Legendary (Requires Attunement)

A dragonlance is a renowned weapon forged from rare metal with the aid of powerful artifacts associated with Bahamut. Different lances are forged for use by foot soldiers (as pikes) and by riders (as lances), but the magical properties of the weapons are the same.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you hit a Dragon with this weapon, the Dragon takes an extra 3d6 force damage, and any Dragon of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you can immediately use its reaction to make a melee attack.
Dragon Wing Bow

Weapon (Any Bow), Rare (Requires Attunement)

The limb tips of this magic bow are shaped like a dragon’s wings, and the weapon is infused with the essence of a chromatic, gem, or metallic dragon’s breath. When you hit with an attack roll using this magic bow, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the same type as the breath infused in the bow—acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder.

If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you pull back the string. The ammunition created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.
Emerald Pen

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This pen is tipped with an emerald nib and requires no ink to write. While holding this pen, you can cast illusory script at will, requiring no material components.

While holding the flail, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause the heads to breathe multicolored flames in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 damage of one of the following damage types (your choice): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. Once this action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Gold Canary Figurine of Wondrous Power

Wondrous Item, Legendary

This gold statuette is carved in the likeness of a canary and is small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature in one of two forms (you choose). If there isn’t enough space for the creature where it would appear, the figurine doesn’t become a creature. The two forms are as follows:

Giant Canary Form. The figurine becomes a giant canary (see the accompanying stat block) for up to 8 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once the figurine has become a giant canary, it can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

Gold Dragon Form. While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you can speak a different command word and the figurine becomes an adult gold dragon (see its stat block in the Monster Manual) for up to 1 hour. The dragon can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions. Once the figurine has become an adult gold dragon, it can’t be used this way again until 1 year has passed.

In either form, the creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. The creature exists for a duration specific to each form. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the description.

Platinum Scarf

Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)

This scarf is made of sturdy cloth and covered in platinum-colored scales.

As an action, you can pull a scale from the scarf and speak a command word. When you do so, choose one of the following effects:

Breath of Life. The scale disappears, and you or a creature you touch regains 10d4 hit points.

Platinum Shield. For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a +1 shield, which you or another creature can use. A creature wielding the shield has immunity to radiant damage.

Radiant Hammer. For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a magic light hammer, which you or another creature can use. The weapon deals 2d4 radiant damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for a light hammer. It deals an extra 2d4 radiant damage to chromatic dragons.

Once three scales have been pulled from the scarf, no more scales can be removed until the next dawn, when all the missing scales grow back. If you pull off a scale but don’t speak a command word, it disappears after 1 minute.
Potion of Dragon’s Majesty

Potion, Legendary

This potion looks like liquid gold, with a single scale from a chromatic, gem, or metallic dragon suspended in it. When you drink this potion, you transform into an adult dragon of the same kind as the dragon the scale came from. The transformation lasts for 1 hour. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying melds into your new form or falls to the ground (your choice). For the duration, you use the game statistics of the adult dragon instead of your own, but you retain your languages, personality, and memories. You can’t use a dragon’s Change Shape or its legendary or lair actions.
Ruby Weave Gem

Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)

While you are holding this gem, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your spells.

The gem has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you cast a spell while holding this gem, you can expend up to 3 charges to ignore the spell’s material components with a gold piece cost, up to 500 gp per charge expended.

When you finish a long rest, choose a spell from any class list. The spell you choose must be of a level you can cast. You know the chosen spell and can cast it with your spell slots of the appropriate level until the end of your next long rest.
Sapphire Buckler

Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

This crystalline blue shield is fashioned from a sapphire dragon’s scale and is created to aid in rooting out the influence of Aberrations. While wielding the shield, you have resistance to psychic and thunder damage. Also, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal 2d6 thunder damage to that creature.

As an action, you can use the shield to help you locate Aberrations until the end of your next turn. If any Aberrations are within 1 mile of you, the shield emits a low humming tone for a moment, and you know the direction of all Aberrations within that range. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Topaz Annihilator

Weapon (Firearm), Legendary (Requires Attunement)

This magic ranged weapon resembles a musket, but in lieu of any ammunition, it holds a glowing yellow scale from a topaz dragon in its heart.

The weapon has a normal range of 100 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it has the two-handed property. It deals 2d6 necrotic damage on a hit. If this damage reduces a creature or object to 0 hit points, the target is reduced to dust. A creature reduced to dust can be restored to life only by a true resurrection or wish spell.

While the weapon is on your person, you can use an action to cast the disintegrate spell (save DC 18). Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Hoard Magic Items

I’ve let adventurers put their toys in my hoard to steep once or twice. I can never get a good night’s sleep while they’re there, though. It’s like an itch.

-Fizban

Certain magic items can absorb the ambient magic of a dragon’s hoard. The mightier the dragon, the more powerful the item becomes when it is steeped in the dragon’s hoard. These items, called hoard items, have four states, which are summarized on the Hoard Item States table. A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring, Wakened, or Ascendant state.
Hoard Item States
State 	Age
Slumbering 	—
Stirring 	Young
Wakened 	Adult
Ascendant 	Ancient
Increasing Power

A hoard item left to steep in a dragon’s hoard absorbs power from the hoard. Older dragons’ hoards are charged with more magic and can empower hoard items to higher states.

Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon’s hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard’s dragon, as shown on the Hoard Item States table. For example, a hoard item that steeps in a young dragon’s hoard for 1 year enters its Stirring state, while one that steeps in an ancient dragon’s hoard for 1 year reaches the pinnacle of its power and enters its Ascendant state. If there are one or more hoard items steeping in a dragon’s hoard, the dragon is aware of them. The dragon also knows what these hoard items are and what state (Slumbering, Stirring, Wakened, or Ascendant) each of them is in.

When a dragon is slain, the magic surrounding its hoard becomes volatile. This allows a hoard item to steep more quickly in the hoard. A hoard item steeped in a dragon’s hoard for 8 hours rises one state (from Slumbering to Stirring, Stirring to Wakened, or Wakened to Ascendant), as long as the steeping begins within 1 hour of the dragon’s death and occurs within the dragon’s lair. Steeping in this way can’t raise the state of the item beyond the state associated with the dragon’s age—putting a Wakened item in a slain adult dragon’s hoard does not make it Ascendant, for example.
Decreasing Power

Just as hoard items can grow in power by absorbing the ambient magic of a dragon’s hoard, so too can these treasures fall back into slumber. If no creature is attuned to a hoard item and that item isn’t in a dragon’s hoard, the item decreases in power by one state every 30 days until it is Slumbering.
Hoard Item Quirks

Hoard items often manifest strange qualities beyond their intended function, regardless of the state they’re in. Roll once on the Draconic Quirks table to determine the quirk of a hoard item.
Draconic Quirks
d8 	Quirk
1 	When resting on the ground, the item points in the direction of the last hoard it steeped in.
2 	The item’s bearer can speak and understand Draconic.
3 	The item glows softly when within 60 feet of a Dragon or another hoard item.
4 	The item’s bearer gains a swimming speed equal to their walking speed.
5 	The item’s bearer has advantage on Intelligence (History) checks.
6 	The item’s bearer has advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against non-Dragons.
7 	The item grants its bearer resistance to the damage type of the breath weapon of the last dragon whose hoard the item steeped in.
8 	The item’s bearer dreams of the dragon whose hoard the item last steeped in.
Hoard Item Descriptions

Hoard items are presented here in alphabetical order. A hoard item’s rarity changes depending on its current state, as shown in each item description.
Dragon’s Wrath Weapon

Weapon (Any), Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon’s hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon’s breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.
A magic weapon recovered from a dragon’s

Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Slumbering (Uncommon). You have advantage on initiative rolls. While you are holding the focus, it can function as a spellcasting focus for all your spells.

Stirring (Rare). The Stirring focus has the Slumbering property, and it gains an additional property determined by the family of the dragon in whose hoard it became Stirring:

Chromatic. Whenever you use a spell slot to cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus equal to the number rolled to one of the spell’s damage rolls.

Gem. Whenever you use a spell slot to cast a spell, you can immediately teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you.

Metallic. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction to give that creature advantage on the saving throw.

Wakened (Very Rare). The Wakened focus has the Slumbering and Stirring properties, and while you are holding a Wakened focus, you can use it to cast certain spells. Once the item is used to cast a given spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells are determined by the family of the dragon in whose hoard it became Wakened. An asterisk indicates a new spell that appears earlier in this chapter.

Chromatic. Hold monster, Rime’s binding ice*

Gem. Rary’s telepathic bond, Raulothim’s psychic lance*

Metallic. Fizban’s platinum shield,* legend lore

Ascendant (Legendary). The Ascendant focus has the Slumbering, Stirring, and Wakened properties. In addition, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher while holding this focus, you can treat the spell as if it were cast using a 9th-level spell slot. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Dragon Vessel

Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)

This vessel can be a potion bottle, drinking horn, or other container meant to hold a liquid.

Slumbering (Uncommon). As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): ale, olive oil, a potion of healing, or a potion of climbing. Once this property is used, it can’t be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way loses its magical properties if it isn’t imbibed within 24 hours.

Stirring (Rare). In addition to the options for a Slumbering vessel, you can fill a Stirring vessel with mead, a potion of fire breath, or a potion of healing (greater).

Wakened (Very Rare). In addition to the options for a Slumbering or Stirring vessel, you can fill a Wakened vessel with wine, a potion of flying, or a potion of healing (superior).

Ascendant (Legendary). In addition to the options for other states, you can fill an Ascendant vessel with whiskey, a potion of healing (supreme), or a potion of dragon’s majesty (described earlier in this chapter).
Scaled Ornament

Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)

This ornament can be jewelry, a cloak, or another wearable accessory. It appears to be fashioned from a dragon’s scale, tooth, or claw, or it incorporates images in those shapes.

Slumbering (Uncommon). You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid being charmed or frightened or to end those conditions on you.

Stirring (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can’t be charmed or frightened. Moreover, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid being charmed or frightened or to end those conditions on itself.

Wakened (Very Rare). The Wakened ornament has the Stirring property. In addition, when you would take damage of the type dealt by the breath of the dragon in whose hoard the ornament became Wakened, you can use your reaction to take no damage instead, and you regain hit points equal to the damage you would have taken. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Ascendant (Legendary). The Ascendant ornament has the Stirring and Wakened properties. In addition, while you are wearing the ornament, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. While you are flying using this speed, spectral dragon wings appear on your back.
Draconic Gifts

You know the proverb: don’t look a draconic gift in the mouth. Some say it’s because of the breath weapon. But really it’s the smell.

-Fizban

As described in chapter 3, the death of a dragon can result in its power taking root in a character, whether that person is the dragon’s chosen heir or the dragon’s killer. The result of this investiture can vary widely in power and impact, from a minor charm to a complete transformation.

Sometimes, a draconic gift has an obvious visual manifestation, such as when a character is transformed into a dragonborn. Other gifts are invisible, but no less potent. But on some worlds, the investiture of draconic power is accompanied by some kind of physical manifestation, especially if it’s derived from slaying a dragon. It might be small and easily hidden, but those who know to look can usually identify a dragonslayer (or another character who carries a draconic gift) by a telltale sign.

Draconic Gift Descriptions

Some of the less common draconic gifts I’ve seen bestowed include chubby cheeks and an adorable nature; the ability to blow immaculate smoke rings; and the innate sense of when your egg is perfectly soft-boiled. I wouldn’t mind that last one myself.

The draconic gifts detailed in this section have rarities like magic items. The rarity of a draconic gift corresponds roughly to the age category of the dragon that bestowed it, as shown in the Draconic Gift Rarity table.

You can use a more common draconic gift for an older dragon, but exercise caution going in the other direction. Very rare and legendary draconic gifts can unbalance the game if they’re given to low-level characters.

    Your heightened senses give you a dragon’s awareness of your surroundings (Alert or Observant).
    Dragon’s blood has made you hardy and resilient (Durable, Resilient, or Tough).
    Exposure to the primal energy of a dragon’s body has given you a magical affinity for one damage type (Elemental Adept).
    You are infused with a dragon’s charismatic gift for inspiration (Inspiring Leader).
    You are imbued with a dragon’s intellect (Keen Mind).
    The dragon’s gift lingers in the form of good luck (Lucky).
    The dragon’s inherent magic has transferred to your own blood (Magic Initiate).

At the DM’s discretion, you might also be able to gain one of the draconic feats described in chapter 1 as a draconic gift.
