Magic Items

This section presents magic items that can be introduced into any campaign. Here you’ll find items of all rarities, including artifacts. Magic spellcasting focuses for every spellcasting class are also available here. And some of the items in this section represent a new type of wondrous item: magic tattoos.

The Magic Items table lists all the magic items in this chapter and notes the rarity of each one. The table also indicates whether an item requires attunement. All the items use the magic items rules in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

Who doesn’t love magic items? The desire for them is one of the few things Mordenkainen and I have in common. And magic tattoos—they’re especially fun. I think tattoos are a reason robes are so popular with wizards. Robes cover the ankle and lower-back tattoos so many of us got as apprentices. Don’t even ask.

Magic Tattoos

Blending magic and artistry with ink and needles, magic tattoos imbue their bearers with wondrous abilities. Magic tattoos are initially bound to magic needles, which transfer their magic to a creature.

Once inscribed on a creature’s body, damage or injury doesn’t impair the tattoo’s function, even if the tattoo is defaced. When applying a magic tattoo, a creature can customize the tattoo’s appearance. A magic tattoo can look like a brand, scarification, a birthmark, patterns of scale, or any other cosmetic alteration.

The rarer a magic tattoo is, the more space it typically occupies on a creature’s skin. The Magic Tattoo Coverage table offers guidelines for how large a given tattoo is.

Common 	One hand or foot or a quarter of a limb
Uncommon 	Half a limb or the scalp

Magic Item Descriptions

The following magic items are presented in alphabetical order.
Absorbing Tattoo

Wondrous item (tattoo), very rare (requires attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo features designs that emphasize one color.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Damage Resistance. While the tattoo is on your skin, you have resistance to a type of damage associated with that color, as shown on the table below. The DM chooses the color or determines it randomly.
d10 	Damage Type 	Color
1 	Acid 	Green
2 	Cold 	Blue
3 	Fire 	Red
4 	Force 	White
5 	Lightning 	Yellow
6 	Necrotic 	Black
7 	Poison 	Violet
8 	Psychic 	Silver
9 	Radiant 	Gold
10 	Thunder 	Orange

Damage Absorption. When you take damage of the chosen type, you can use your reaction to gain immunity against that instance of the damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken. Once this reaction is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Alchemical Compendium

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)

Acrid odors cling to this stained, heavy volume. The book’s metal fittings are copper, iron, lead, silver, and gold, some frozen mid-transition from one metal to another. When found, the book contains the following spells: enlarge/reduce, feather fall, flesh to stone, gaseous form, magic weapon, and polymorph. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

    If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the transmutation school.
    As an action, you can touch a nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried and spend a number of charges to transform the target into another object. For 1 charge, the object can be no larger than 1 foot on a side. You can spend additional charges to increase the maximum dimensions by 2 feet per charge. The new object must have a gold value equal to or less than the original.

All-Purpose Tool

Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3) (requires attunement by an artificer)

This simple screwdriver can transform into a variety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of artisan’s tool of your choice (see the “Equipment” chapter in the Player’s Handbook for a list of artisan’s tools). Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it.

While holding this tool, you gain a bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells. The bonus is determined by the tool’s rarity.

As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don’t know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Amulet of the Devout

Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)

This amulet bears the symbol of a deity inlaid with precious stones or metals. While you wear the holy symbol, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your spells. The bonus is determined by the amulet’s rarity.

While you wear this amulet, you can use your Channel Divinity feature without expending one of the feature’s uses. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Arcane Grimoire

Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a wizard)

While you are holding this leather-bound book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your wizard spells. The bonus is determined by the book’s rarity.

You can use this book as a spellbook. In addition, when you use your Arcane Recovery feature, you can increase the number of spell slot levels you regain by 1.
Astral Shard

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)

This crystal is a solidified shard of the Astral Plane, swirling with silver mist. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, immediately after casting the spell you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you.
Astromancy Archive

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)

This brass disc of articulated, concentric rings unfolds into an armillary sphere. As a bonus action, you can unfold it into the sphere or back into a disc. When found, it contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to it: augury, divination, find the path, foresight, locate creature, and locate object. It functions as a spellbook for you, with spells encoded on the rings.

While you are holding the archive, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The archive has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

    If you spend 1 minute studying the archive, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the archive. The new spell must be of the divination school.
    When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and force the creature to roll a d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the original roll. You can do this after you see the roll but before its effects are applied.

Atlas of Endless Horizons

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)
Atlas of Endless Horizons

This thick book is bound in dark leather, crisscrossed with inlaid silver lines suggesting a map or chart. When found, the book contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to the book: arcane gate, dimension door, gate, misty step, plane shift, teleportation circle, and word of recall. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

    If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the conjuration school.
    When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If your new position is out of range of the attack, it misses you.

Baba Yaga’s Mortar and Pestle

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga’s Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn

Random Properties. This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “Artifacts” section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:

    2 minor beneficial properties
    1 major beneficial property
    1 minor detrimental property

A night hag takes Baba Yaga’s
Mortar and Pestle for a spin

Properties of the Mortar. The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding—if there’s enough space—up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.

Properties of the Pestle. The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Perfect Tools. While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

You can also use the artifact as alchemist’s supplies, brewer’s supplies, cook’s utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner’s kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.

Primal Parts. As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that’s equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target’s hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents—like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs—into separate piles.

Traverse the Night. If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don’t need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination—not just the nearest river or a red dragon’s lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.

Bones Know Their Home. When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.

Destroying the Mortar and Pestle. The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga or by Baba Yaga herself.
Barrier Tattoo

Wondrous item (tattoo), rarity varies (requires attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo depicts protective imagery and uses ink that resembles liquid metal.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Protection. While you aren’t wearing armor, the tattoo grants you an Armor Class depending on the tattoo’s rarity, as shown below. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
Rarity 	AC
Uncommon 	12 + your Dexterity modifier
Rare 	15 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of +2)
Very Rare 	18
Bell Branch

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a druid or warlock)

This silver implement is shaped like a tree branch and is strung with small golden bells. The branch is a spellcasting focus for your spells while you hold it.

The branch has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

    As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to detect the presence of aberrations, celestials, constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead within 60 feet of you. If such creatures are present and don’t have total cover from you, the bells ring softly, their tone indicating the creature types present.
    As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast protection from evil and good.

Blood Fury Tattoo

Wondrous item (tattoo), legendary (requires attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo evokes fury in its form and colors.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Bloodthirsty Strikes. The tattoo has 10 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While this tattoo is on your skin, you gain the following benefits:

    When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a charge to deal an extra 4d6 necrotic damage to the target, and you regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
    When a creature you can see damages you, you can expend a charge and use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature, with advantage on your attack roll.

Bloodwell Vial

Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a sorcerer)

To attune to this vial, you must place a few drops of your blood into it. The vial can’t be opened while your attunement to it lasts. If your attunement to the vial ends, the contained blood turns to ash. You can use the vial as a spellcasting focus for your spells while wearing or holding it, and you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your sorcerer spells. The bonus is determined by the vial’s rarity.

In addition, when you roll any Hit Dice to recover hit points while you are carrying the vial, you can regain 5 sorcery points. This property of the vial can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Cauldron of Rebirth

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a druid or warlock)

This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast iron sides. You can use the cauldron as a spellcasting focus for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the scrying spell. When you finish a long rest, you can use the cauldron to create a potion of greater healing. The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.

As an action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as an action, harmlessly shunting anything that can’t fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.

If you place the corpse of a humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 gp) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by raise dead at the next dawn. Once used, this property can’t be used again for 7 days.
Cauldron of Rebirth
Coiling Grasp Tattoo

Wondrous item (tattoo), uncommon (requires attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo has long intertwining designs.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Grasping Tendrils. While the tattoo is on your skin, you can, as an action, cause the tattoo to extrude into inky tendrils, which reach for a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 3d6 force damage and be grappled by you. As an action, the creature can escape the grapple by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The grapple also ends if you halt it (no action required), if the creature is ever more than 15 feet away from you, or if you use this tattoo on a different creature.
Crook of Rao

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse—and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact’s bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao—potentially for the final time.

Random Properties. The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “Artifacts” section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:
Crook of Rao

    2 minor beneficial properties
    1 major beneficial property
    1 minor detrimental property

Spells. The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2 charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

Absolute Banishment. While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can’t return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years.

Failing Matrix. Whenever the Crook of Rao’s Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.
Extraplanar Reversal
d100 	Effect
1–25 	A portal to a random plane opens. The portal closes after 5 minutes.
26–45 	2d4 imps and 2d4 quasits appear.
46–60 	1d8 succubi/incubi appear.
61–70 	1d10 barbed devils and 1d10 vrocks appear.
71–80 	1 arcanaloth, 1 night hag, and 1 rakshasa appear.
81–85 	1 ice devil and 1 marilith appear.
86–90 	1 balor and 1 pit fiend appear. At the DM’s discretion, a portal opens into the presence of an archdevil or demon lord instead, then closes after 5 minutes.
91–00 	Iggwilv’s Curse (see the Iggwilv’s Curse property).

Iggwilv’s Curse. When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend’s name in Iggwilv’s voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.

Destroying or Repairing the Crook. The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god’s tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.
Crystalline Chronicle

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)
Crystalline Chronicle

An etched crystal sphere the size of a grapefruit hums faintly and pulses with irregular flares of inner light. While you are touching the crystal, you can retrieve and store information and spells within the crystal at the same rate as reading and writing. When found, the crystal contains the following spells: detect thoughts, intellect fortress,* Rary’s telepathic bond, sending, telekinesis, Tasha’s mind whip,* and Tenser’s floating disk (spells with an asterisk appear in this book). It functions as a spellbook for you, with its spells and other writing psychically encoded within it.

While you are holding the crystal, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and you know the mage hand, mind sliver (appears in this book), and message cantrips if you don’t already know them.

The crystal has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

    If you spend 1 minute studying the information within the crystal, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the crystal.
    When you cast a wizard spell, you can expend 1 charge to cast the spell without verbal, somatic, or material components of up to 100 gp value.

Demonomicon of Iggwilv

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss’s infinite layers and inhabitants, the Demonomicon of Iggwilv is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book’s spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.

Random Properties. The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “Artifacts” section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:
Demonomicon of Iggwilv

    2 minor beneficial properties
    1 minor detrimental property
    1 major detrimental property

Spells. The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast Tasha’s hideous laughter from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: magic circle (1 charge), magic jar (3 charges), planar ally (3 charges), planar binding (2 charges), plane shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), summon fiend (3 charges; appears in this book).

Abyssal Reference. You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.

Fiendish Scourging. Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.

Ensnarement. While carrying the book, whenever you cast the magic circle spell naming only fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.

Containment. The first 10 pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon’s empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature’s widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.

When you finish a long rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can’t try to possess you again for 7 days.

When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.

Destroying the Demonomicon. To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book’s pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book’s remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, Fraz-Urb’luu’s Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation for the Demonomicon. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb’luu instantly knows.
Devotee’s Censer

Weapon (flail), rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)

The rounded head of this flail is perforated with tiny holes, arranged in symbols and patterns. The flail counts as a holy symbol for you. When you hit with an attack using this magic flail, the target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

As a bonus action, you can speak the command word to cause the flail to emanate a thin cloud of incense out to 10 feet for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, you and any other creatures in the incense each regain 1d4 hit points. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Devotee’s Censer
Duplicitous Manuscript

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)

To you, this book is a magical spellbook. To anyone else, the book appears to be a volume of verbose romance fiction. As an action, you can change the book’s appearance and alter the plot of the romance.

When found, the book contains the following spells: hallucinatory terrain, major image, mirror image, mislead, Nystul’s magic aura, phantasmal force, and silent image. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

    If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the illusion school.
    When a creature you can see makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern the true nature of an illusion spell you cast, or makes a saving throw against an illusion spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the roll.

Eldritch Claw Tattoo

Wondrous item (tattoo), uncommon (requires attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo depicts clawlike forms and other jagged shapes.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Magical Strikes. While the tattoo is on your skin, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes.

Eldritch Maul. As a bonus action, you can empower the tattoo for 1 minute. For the duration, each of your melee attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can reach a target up to 15 feet away from you, as inky tendrils launch toward the target. In addition, your melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 force damage on a hit. Once used, this bonus action can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Elemental Essence Shard

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)

This crackling crystal contains the essence of an elemental plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

Roll a d4 and consult the Elemental Essence Shards table to determine the shard’s essence and property. When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.
Elemental Essence Shards
d4 	Property
1 	Air. You can immediately fly up to 60 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
2 	Earth. You gain resistance to a damage type of your choice until the start of your next turn.
3 	Fire. One target of the spell that you can see catches fire. The burning target takes 2d10 fire damage at the start of its next turn, and then the flames go out.
4 	Water. You create a wave of water that bursts out from you in a 10-foot radius. Each creature of your choice that you can see in that area takes 2d6 cold damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed 10 feet away from you and fall prone.
Far Realm Shard

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)

This writhing crystal is steeped in the warped essence of the Far Realm. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can cause a slimy tentacle to rip through the fabric of reality and strike one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or take 3d6 psychic damage and become frightened of you until the start of your next turn.
Left to Right: Far Realm, Feywild, and Shadowfell Shards
Feywild Shard

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a sorcerer)

This warm crystal glints with the sunset colors of the Feywild sky and evokes whispers of emotional memory. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player’s Handbook. If the result is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

If you don’t have the Wild Magic Sorcerous Origin, once this property is used to roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Luba’s Tarokka of Souls

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.
Luba’s Tarokka of Souls

Created by a figure of Vistani legend, Luba’s Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck’s creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarokka deck. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.

Like all tarokka decks, the Tarokka of Souls is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.

Random Properties. The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “Artifacts” section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:

    2 minor detrimental properties
    2 minor beneficial properties

Spells. While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: comprehend languages, detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, locate object, or scrying. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can’t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.

Enduring Vision. While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells.

Twist of Fate. As an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:

Weal. The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.

Woe. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.

The deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.

Prisoners of Fate. Whenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll d100 and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the Monster Manual. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.
Souls of the Tarokka
d100 	Card 	Soul
1 	Artifact 	Flameskull
2 	Beast 	Wraith
3 	Broken One 	Banshee
4 	Darklord 	Vampire
5 	Donjon 	Mummy
6 	Executioner 	Death knight
7 	Ghost 	Ghost
8 	Horseman 	Mummy lord
9 	Innocent 	Ghost
10 	Marionette 	Mummy
11 	Mists 	Wraith
12 	Raven 	Vampire spawn
13 	Seer 	Vampire
14 	Tempter 	Vampire spawn
15–00 	— 	—

The released soul appears at a random location within 10d10 miles of you and terrorizes the living. Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck’s Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe.

Shuffling Fate. If you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba’s Tarokka of Souls ends, and you can’t attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you.

Destroying the Deck. Luba’s Tarokka of Souls can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a lich, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka deck, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM’s design.

MOTHER LUBA AND THE VISTANI

The creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell’s horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.

A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience—ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. “We may wander amid the shadows,” Mother Luba said. “But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.”

Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.
Lyre of Building

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)

While holding this lyre, you can cast mending as an action. You can also play the lyre as a reaction when an object or a structure you can see within 300 feet of you takes damage, causing it to be immune to that damage and any further damage of the same type until the start of your next turn.

In addition, you can play the lyre as an action to cast fabricate, move earth, passwall, or summon construct (appears in this book), and that spell can’t be cast from it again until the next dawn.
Masquerade Tattoo

Wondrous item (tattoo), common (requires attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo appears on your body as whatever you desire.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Fluid Ink. As a bonus action, you can shape the tattoo into any color or pattern and move it to any area of your skin. Whatever form it takes, it is always obviously a tattoo. It can range in size from no smaller than a copper piece to an intricate work of art that covers all your skin.

Disguise Self. As an action, you can use the tattoo to cast the disguise self spell (DC 13 to discern the disguise). Once the spell is cast from the tattoo, it can’t be cast from the tattoo again until the next dawn.
Mighty Servant of Leuk-o

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)
Mighty Servant of Leuk-o

Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it—and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.

Tales of the servant’s origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the Machine of Lum the Mad. The best details on the device’s origins and operation can be found in the Mind of Metal, a tome of artificer’s secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad’s several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.

Dangerous Attunement. Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.

The servant’s controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.

Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.

Controlling the Servant. While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster’s next turn.

A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.

While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:

    Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)
    Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)
    As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.
    When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.

While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.

Ghost in the Machine. Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM’s discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.

If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact—preferably using the servant, if possible.

Self-Destruct. By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant’s two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.

If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.

This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.

Destroying the Servant. The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant’s self-destruct property.

To use the tattoo, you must hold the needle against your skin and speak the command word. The needle turns into ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin in whatever design you like. Once the tattoo is there, you can cast its spell, requiring no material components. The tattoo glows faintly while you cast the spell and for the spell’s duration. Once the spell ends, the tattoo vanishes from your skin.

The level of the spell in the tattoo determines the spell’s saving throw DC, attack bonus, spellcasting ability modifier, and the tattoo’s rarity, as shown in the Spellwrought Tattoo table.

Teeth of Dahlver-Nar

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

The Teeth of Dahlver-Nar are stories given form. They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of wildly different origins and made from various materials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.
A Tooth of Dahlver-Nar

Using the Teeth. While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).

If you don’t sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).

Each tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth’s result is rolled after it’s been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.

Sowing Teeth. To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.

Implanting Teeth. To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can’t be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.

Recovering Teeth. Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.

Destroying the Teeth. Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth’s story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.
