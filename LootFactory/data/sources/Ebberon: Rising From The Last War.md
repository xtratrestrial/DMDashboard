Chapter 5: Treasures

Magic plays a vital role in the day-to-day life of Khorvaire. Common magic items are widespread, and the crystals known as dragonshards serve as the fuel of the magical economy and are used in items that amplify the powers of dragonmarks.

Dragonshards

Dragonshards aren't magic items themselves but are crystals imbued with magical energy. They play a vital role in the creation of magic items and the performance of certain rituals in Eberron. Dragonshards come in three varieties, each found in a different environment.

Eberron dragonshards are found in shallow soil and often encased in geode-like stone shells. Eberron dragonshards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q'barra and Xen'drik. In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise (the dust's market value is the same as the replaced component). Eberron dragonshard dust is used in the creation of some magic items, and many powerful tools — such as the lightning rail and elemental airships — require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.

Khyber dragonshards are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding — which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleons — requires a Khyber dragonshard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, and other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards can also be used for necromantic rites.

Siberys dragonshards fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant Siberys dragonshard fields in the continent of Xen'drik, and this is a potential source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within. These dragonshards are used in the crafting of magic items that require dragonmarks for attunement. Larger ones may be required for eldritch machines or the creation of legendary items or artifacts.
Magic Items

The world of Eberron thrums with the power of magic. Artificers, magewrights, wizards, and other spellcasters produce an abundance of magic items, particularly those with the common rarity.

This section presents a selection of magic items in alphabetical order. See the Dungeon Master's Guide for the rules on using magic items.

Some of the magic items in this chapter are symbiotic objects created by the daelkyr. While not fully sentient, these symbiotic items are partially organic. Attuning to such an item reflects physically bonding with it. While these objects aren't evil, some people might be disturbed upon seeing your living armor or tentacle whip!
Arcane Propulsion Arm

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a creature missing a hand or an arm)

This prosthetic appendage was developed by artificers of House Cannith. To attune to this item, you must attach it to your arm at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder, at which point the prosthetic magically forms a copy of the appendage it's replacing.

While attached, the prosthetic provides these benefits:

    The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body.
    You can take an action to remove the prosthetic, and it removes itself if your attunement to it ends. It can't be removed against your will.
    The prosthetic is a magic melee weapon with which you're proficient. It deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the prosthetic detaches and flies at the target of the attack, then immediately returns to you and reattaches.

Armblade

Weapon (any one-handed melee weapon), common (requires attunement by a warforged)

An armblade is a magic weapon that attaches to your arm, becoming inseparable from you as long as you're attuned to it. To attune to this item, you must hold it against your forearm for the entire attunement period.

As a bonus action, you can retract the armblade into your forearm or extend it from there. While it is extended, you can use the weapon as if you were holding it, and you can't use that hand for other purposes.
Belashyrra's Beholder Crown

Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)

This symbiotic crown is carved from dark purple and mauve stone, with ten points like stalks set with gemstones resembling the eyestalks of a beholder. To attune to this item, you must wear it on your head for the entire attunement period, during which the crown's hidden tendrils burrow into your scalp to bond with your skull.

While wearing the crown, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

Spells. The crown has 10 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 16): charm person (1 charge), disintegrate (6 charges), fear (3 charges), finger of death (7 charges), flesh to stone (6 charges), hold person (2 charges), ray of enfeeblement (2 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (3 charges), telekinesis (5 charges).

The crown regains 1d6 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Symbiotic Nature. The crown can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the crown ends, and it detaches from you.

The daelkyr Belashyrra made these crowns. While on the same plane of existence as the crown, Belashyrra can see through its eyestalks.
Cleansing Stone

Wondrous item, common

A cleansing stone is a sphere 1 foot in diameter, engraved with mystic sigils. When touching the stone, you can use an action to activate it and remove dirt and grime from your garments and your person.

Such stones are often embedded in pedestals in public squares in Aundair or in high-end Ghallanda inns.
Docent

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a warforged)

A docent is a small metal sphere, about 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. To attune to a docent, you must embed the item somewhere on your body, such as your chest or your eye socket.

Sentience. A docent is a sentient item of any alignment with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It perceives the world through your senses. It communicates telepathically with you and can speak, read, and understand any language it knows (see "Random Properties" below).

Life Support. Whenever you end your turn with 0 hit points, the docent can make a Wisdom (Medicine) check with a +6 bonus. If this check succeeds, the docent stabilizes you.

Random Properties. A docent has the following properties:

Languages. The docent knows Common, Giant, and 1d4 additional languages chosen by the DM. If a docent knows fewer than six languages, it can learn a new language after it hears or reads the language through your senses.

Skills. The docent has a +7 bonus to one of the following skills (roll a d4): (1) Arcana, (2) History, (3) Investigation, or (4) Nature.

Spells. The docent knows one of the following spells and can cast it at will, requiring no components (roll a d6): (1–2) detect evil and good or (3–6) detect magic. The docent decides when to cast the spell.

Personality. A docent is designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. The docent's properties are under its control, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent, it might refuse to assist you.
Dyrrn's Tentacle Whip

Weapon (whip), very rare (requires attunement)

This long, whip-like strand of tough muscle bears a sharp stinger at one end. To attune to this symbiotic weapon, you wrap the whip around your wrist for the entire attunement period, during which time the whip painfully embeds its tendrils into your arm.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip, but attack rolls made against aberrations with this weapon have disadvantage. A creature hit by this weapon takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage. When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll with this weapon, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.

As a bonus action, you can sheathe the whip by causing it to retract into your arm, or draw the whip out of your arm again.

Symbiotic Nature. The whip can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the whip ends, and it detaches from you.
Earworm

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

To attune to this symbiont, you must hold it against the skin behind your ear for the entire attunement period, whereupon it burrows into your head and bonds to your skull. While the earworm is inside you, you can speak, read, and write Deep Speech.

Spells. The earworm has 4 charges. You can cast the following spells from it, expending the necessary number of charges (spell save DC 15): detect thoughts (2 charges) or dissonant whispers (1 charge). Each time you use the earworm to cast the detect thoughts spell, it sends the information gleaned to the nearest daelkyr, or to the next nearest earworm until it reaches a daelkyr.

The earworm regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

Symbiotic Nature. The earworm can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the earworm ends, and it exits your body.
Everbright Lantern

Wondrous item, common

This bullseye lantern contains an Eberron dragonshard that sheds light comparable to that produced by a continual flame spell. An everbright lantern sheds light in a 120-foot cone; the closest 60 feet is bright light, and the farthest 60 feet is dim light.
Feather Token

Wondrous item, common

This small metal disk is inscribed with the image of a feather. When you fall at least 20 feet while the token is on your person, you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling. The token's magic is expended after you land, whereupon the disk becomes nonmagical.
Finder's Goggles

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a creature with the Mark of Finding)

The lenses of these garish goggles are carved from Siberys dragonshards. While wearing these lenses, you gain the following benefits:

    When you make a Wisdom (Insight) check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check.
    As an action, you can use the goggles to examine an object to identify the aura of the last creature that touched it. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a DC of 13 + the number of days since the last contact occurred. On a success, you learn the creature's type and can immediately use the goggles to cast locate creature to find that creature. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Glamerweave

Wondrous item, common or uncommon

Glamerweave is clothing imbued with harmless illusory magic. While wearing the common version of these clothes, you can use a bonus action to create a moving illusory pattern within the cloth.

Uncommon glamerweave can have the pattern rise from the cloth. For example, a glamerweave gown might be wreathed in harmless, illusory flames, while a glamerweave hat might have illusory butterflies fluttering around it.

When you make a Charisma (Performance) or Charisma (Persuasion) check while wearing the uncommon version of glamerweave, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
Imbued Wood Focus

Wondrous item, common (requires attunement)

An imbued wood focus is a rod, staff, or wand cut from a tree infused with extraplanar energy. If you're a spellcaster, you can use this orb as a spellcasting focus.

When you cast a damage-dealing spell using this item as your spellcasting focus, you gain a +1 bonus to one damage roll of the spell, provided the damage is of the type associated with the item's wood. The types of wood and their associated damage types are listed in the Imbued Wood Focus table.
Imbued Wood Focus
Wood 	Damage Type
Fernian Ash 	Fire
Irian Rosewood 	Radiant
Kythrian Manchineel 	Acid or poison
Lamannian Oak 	Lightning or thunder
Mabaran Ebony 	Necrotic
Risian Pine 	Cold
Shavarran Birch 	Force
Xorian Wenge 	Psychic
Keycharm

Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a creature with the Mark of Warding)

This small stylized key plays a vital role in the work of House Kundarak. If you cast the alarm, arcane lock, or glyph of warding spell, you can tie the effect to the keycharm so that whoever holds it receives the notification from the alarm spell, bypasses the lock of the arcane lock spell, or avoids triggering the glyph placed by the glyph of warding spell. In addition, the holder (who needn't be attuned to the item) can take an action to end any one spell tied to it, provided the holder knows the command word you set for ending the tied spells. The keycharm can have up to three tied spells at one time.
Kyrzin's Ooze

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This opalescent, symbiotic goo comes sealed in a jar and slowly shifts and moves, as if endlessly exploring the jar's interior. To attune to this item, you must first drink the contents of the jar, unlocking the following properties.

Resistant. While attuned to Kyrzin's ooze, you have resistance to poison and acid damage, and you're immune to the poisoned condition.

Amorphous. As an action, you can speak a command word and cause your body to assume the amorphous qualities of an ooze. For the next minute, you (along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying) can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Acid Breath. As an action, you can exhale acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Symbiotic Nature. The ooze can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the ooze ends, as it seeps out of you.

If you die while the ooze is inside you, it bursts out and engulfs you, turning your corpse into a black pudding allied with the daelkyr (see the Monster Manual for the black pudding's stat block).
Living Armor

Armor (any), very rare (requires attunement)

This hideous armor is formed from black chitin, beneath which veins pulse and red sinews glisten. To attune to this item, you must wear it for the entire attunement period, during which tendrils on the inside burrow into you.

While wearing this armor, you have a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and you have resistance to the following damage types: necrotic, poison, and psychic.

Symbiotic Nature. The armor can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the armor ends, and it detaches from you.

The armor requires fresh blood be fed to it. Immediately after you finish any long rest, you must either feed half of your remaining Hit Dice to the armor (round up) or take 1 level of exhaustion.
Living Gloves

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

These symbiotic gloves — made of thin chitin and sinew — pulse with a life of their own. To attune to them, you must wear them for the entire attunement period, during which the gloves bond with your skin.

While attuned to these gloves, you gain one of the following proficiencies (your choice when you attune to the gloves):

    Sleight of Hand
    Thieves' tools
    One kind of artisan's tools of your choice
    One kind of musical instrument of your choice

When you make an ability check using the chosen proficiency, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

Symbiotic Nature. The gloves can't be removed from you while you're attuned to them, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the gloves ends, and they can be removed.
Orb of Shielding

Wondrous item, common (requires attunement)

An orb of shielding is a polished, spherical chunk of crystal or stone aligned to one of the planes of existence. If you're a spellcaster, you can use this orb as a spellcasting focus.

If you're holding the orb when you take damage of the type associated with the orb's material, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d4 (to a minimum of 0). The materials and their associated damage types are listed in the Orb of Shielding table.
Orb of Shielding
Planar Material 	Damage Type
Fernian basalt 	Fire
Irian quartz 	Radiant
Kythrian skarn 	Acid and poison
Lamannian flint 	Lightning and thunder
Mabaran obsidian 	Necrotic
Risian shale 	Cold
Shavarran chert 	Force
Xorian marble 	Psychic
Prosthetic Limb

Wondrous item, common

This item replaces a lost limb—a hand, an arm, a foot, a leg, or a similar body part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. You can detach or reattach it as an action, and it can't be removed against your will. It detaches if you die.
Prosthetic Limb (Arm)
Scribe's Pen

Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a creature with the Mark of Scribing)

You can use this pen to write on any surface. You decide whether the writing is visible or invisible, but the writing is always visible to a person with the Mark of Scribing.

Any creature with the Mark of Scribing can use an action to touch the invisible writing, making it visible to all.

If you use the pen to write on a creature that isn't a construct, the writing fades after 7 days.
Shiftweave

Wondrous item, common

When a suit of shiftweave is created, up to five different outfits can be embedded into the cloth. While wearing the clothing, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to transform your outfit into your choice of one of the other designs contained within it. Regardless of its appearance, the outfit can't be anything but clothing. Although it can duplicate the look of other magical clothing, it doesn't gain their magical properties.
Speaking Stone

Wondrous item, very rare

The key to long-distance, virtually instantaneous communication across Khorvaire is House Sivis's network of message stations. Each station contains at least one speaking stone, which is carved from a Siberys dragonshard and inscribed with arcane symbols that uniquely identify it. If you're a gnome with the Mark of Scribing, you can touch the stone and use an action to cast the sending spell from it. The target is any other speaking stone whose location or unique sequence of symbols you know. A creature within 5 feet of the stone hears the message as if they were the target.

In a Sivis message station, a gnome is always on duty by the speaking stone, listening for messages that might come in and transcribing them for delivery to their intended recipients.
Spellshard

Wondrous item, common

This polished Eberron dragonshard fits in the hand and stores information similar to a book. The shard can hold the equivalent of one book that's no more than 320 pages long. A shard can be created blank or already filled with information. When the shard is created, the creator can set a passphrase that must be spoken to access the information stored within.

While holding the shard, you can use an action to open your mind to the shard, seeing its content in your mind. On subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing new text on blank "pages" in the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) and takes the same amount of time it takes you to read and write normally. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic draws you to the first section in the shard that addresses it.

A wizard can use a spellshard as a spellbook, with the usual cost in gold and time to "scribe" a spell into the shard.
Ventilating Lungs

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

These metallic nodules were created in response to the poisonous gases used on the battlefields of the Last War. When you attune to these lungs, they replace the lungs in your chest, which disappear. The lungs allow you to breathe normally, even in an antimagic field, and their breathing function can't be suppressed by magic.

Outside an antimagic field or any other effect that suppresses magic, these lungs allow you to breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum), and you have advantage on saving throws against harmful gases such as those created by a cloudkill spell, a stinking cloud spell, inhaled poisons, and gaseous breath weapons.

As an action, you can use these lungs to exhale a gust of wind, as if you had cast the gust of wind spell (spell save DC 15) with no components. This property of the lungs can't be used again until the next dawn.

If your attunement to the lungs ends, your original lungs reappear.
Wand Sheath

Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a warforged)

A wand sheath clamps onto your arm and imparts the following benefits:

    The wand sheath can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it.
    You can insert a wand into the sheath as an action. The sheath can hold only one wand at a time.
    You can retract or extend a wand from the sheath as a bonus action. While the wand is extended, you can use it as if you were holding it, but your hand remains free.

If a sheathed wand requires attunement, you must attune to the wand before you can use it. However, the wand sheath and the attached wand count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. If you remove the wand from the sheath, your attunement to the wand ends.
Wheel of Wind and Water

Wondrous item, uncommon

When mounted at the helm of an elemental galleon or airship, this wheel allows a creature that possesses the Mark of Storm to telepathically control the elemental bound inside the vessel.

If a wheel of wind and water is mounted on a mundane sailing ship, a creature with the Mark of Storm who is using the wheel can create an area of ideal conditions around the vessel, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour.
Eldritch Machines

In a Cannith enclave, a team of artificers maintain a creation forge that produces warforged. In the Shadow Marches, druids guard the seals that hold the daelkyr at bay. In the sewers below Sharn, a mad necromancer puts the final touches on a device that will turn the city's residents into undead. Such contraptions are categorized as eldritch machines — magical devices of immense power that are too large to be moved easily. Eldritch machines are marvels of magic and engineering that require special components and conditions to function. For example, a particular eldritch machine might function only in a manifest zone where two or more planes are coterminous.

Ultimately, eldritch machines are plot devices that can represent the culmination of a villain's master plan or a last defense against evil.
Creation Forge

A creation forge is a spherical chamber that contains a floating obelisk. This obelisk creates warforged souls and places them in newly constructed warforged bodies. Only dragonmarked members of House Cannith can create and maintain such devices, and though the Treaty of Thronehold mandated the destruction of all creation forges in Khorvaire after the Last War, at least one creation forge is rumored to exist in the bowels of Sharn.
Dimensional Seal

A dimensional seal is a massive stone slab covered with a complex pattern of runes and sigils. The seal projects an invisible field in a 2-mile radius. This field blocks all forms of conjuration magic and any other effect that involves teleportation or planar travel. Dimensional seals are usually found in the Eldeen Reaches and the Shadow Marches — reminders of the conflict between the Gatekeepers and the daelkyr. The techniques used to create these seals have been long lost. It's said that as a whole, the dimensional seals keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber and prevent Xoriat from becoming coterminous with Eberron. If enough of these seals are destroyed, there could be dire consequences for the world.
Mabaran Resonator
Storm Spire

This dread device draws on the power of Mabar, infusing the dead with the malign energy of the Endless Night. While it is active, any humanoid that dies within 2 miles of the resonator reanimates 1 minute later as a zombie (see the Monster Manual for its stat block) under the control of the creature controlling the device.
Master's Call

While this looks like a scrap heap assembled from shattered constructs, this eldritch machine possesses great power. A creature in control of it can sense the presence and location of all warforged within 10 miles of the device and can, as an action, send a telepathic message to them laced with enchantment magic. Such a message can be sent no more than once every 24 hours. A warforged who receives the message is compelled to follow one command contained within it, unless the warforged succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. The affected warforged breaks free of the command after 24 hours.
Spell Sink

This device emanates an antimagic field (same effects as the antimagic field spell) in a radius of 1 to 3 miles. The field can be activated or deactivated as an action with a touch by its controller.

The form that the device takes depends on the nature of its creator. The Ashbound druids despise unnatural magic, so a spell sink created by them might be a living artifact, such as a twisted tree that consumes the magical energy around it. Conversely, a spell sink created by a mad artificer might be a massive vessel composed of dragonshards and exotic metals.

A variant device called the spell siphon not only neutralizes magic but also absorbs all magical energy in the area, storing that power for a cataclysmic effect.
Storm Spire

This eldritch machine can only be controlled by creatures that bear the Mark of Storm. Storm spires allow House Lyrandar to influence the weather, which can be a boon for the local population or a curse if a Lyrandar baron chooses to demand payment for ideal weather.
Everyday Magic Items

Thanks to dragonshards, common magic items — including the ones in Xanathar's Guide to Everything — are readily available in Khorvaire.
Buying a Common Magic item

In Eberron, common magic items can be found for sale in most communities. The DM determines the stock that is available, or the DM has the shoppers make a group Intelligence (Investigation) check to find a shop or peddler that has the desired item in stock. The DC for this check is 10 in a city, 15 in a town, and 20 in a village. If the check fails, at least 24 hours must pass before looking for the same item in that community.

The DM sets the price of a common magic item or determines it randomly: 2d4 × 10 gp, or half as much for a consumable item such as a potion or scroll.
Creating Common Magic Items

Normally, a magic item in Eberron is created using the crafting rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide or Xanathar's Guide to Everything. But if you have a dragonshard, you can more easily create a common magic item.

To create such an item with a dragonshard, a character must have proficiency in the tools used to create a nonmagical version of the item or proficiency in the Arcana skill. For example, a potion of healing can be created by a character who has proficiency with the herbalism kit. A spellcaster can scribe a spell scroll of a spell they know if they have proficiency in the Arcana skill, and they must provide all material components required for the spell. A cantrip scribed onto a scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.

The Creating Common Magic Items table states how much time and money you must spend to craft a common magic item with a dragonshard, which is expended in the creation process. The hours of creation can be spread over multiple days, which needn't be consecutive.
Creating Common Magic Items
Common Magic Item 	Time 	Cost
Spell scroll (cantrip) 	8 hours 	15 gp
Potion of healing 	8 hours 	25 gp
Any other common magic item 	32 hours* 	50 gp*

*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll
Crafting Complications

If the DM is using the crafting rules in Xanathar's Guide to Everything for items that aren't common, the creation process can involve complications. Assume there's a 10 percent chance of a complication arising for every five workweeks (25 days) spent on crafting the item. Xanathar's Guide to Everything presents a number of possible complications, or you can use the Eberron Crafting Complications table.
Eberron Crafting Complications
d6 	Complication
1 	House Cannith or another dragonmarked house takes an interest in your work. Do they view you as a threat, or are they impressed by your techniques?
2 	A mishap creates a temporary manifest zone (see "The Planes of Existence" in chapter 4 for information on manifest zones).
3 	You need to acquire an additional rare component to complete your work. Time for adventure!
4 	The shifting balance of the planes interferes with your work; you must wait for the current planar alignment to change. This delays your work by 2d6 days.
5 	Your efforts draw the attention of the Aurum, the Chamber, the Emerald Claw, or the Lords of Dust.
6 	Your item becomes sentient (see chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on sentient items).
