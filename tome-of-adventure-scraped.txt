INTRODUCTION
A fantasy adventure game, at its very heart, is about developing
an open-ended “story” of the characters. The referee is in charge
of the fantasy world, and the players direct the actions of their
characters in that fantasy world. Neither the referee nor the group
of players has complete control over what’s going to happen, and
the result is an evolving set of surprises for both the referee and the
players. Unlike the players, as the referee and creator of the game
world, most of your “work” is done ahead of time. To some degree
or other, you have to create the groundwork for the adventure before
the game starts. Even though no battle plan survives contact with
the enemy – and if you’re an experienced referee you know exactly
what I mean – the game has to start … with a starting point. This
might just be a vague set of ideas, or it might be as complex as a set
of maps with a detailed key and well thought-out encounters for the
players to run into.
The Tome of Adventure Design is organized as a series of “books,”
each one providing resources at every step of the way. The vast majority of the content of each book is made up of random generation
tables that I’ve created over a quarter of a century for my own use.
I should say up front that these are tables for deep design – in other
words, most of them are too long, and contain too many unusual
or contradictory entries, for use on the spot at the gaming table.
There are already many excellent books of tables for use on the fly;
the tables in these books are different. They work best as a tool for
preparation beforehand, providing relatively vast creative resources
for browsing and gathering, rather than quick-use tables designed to
provide broad, fast brushstrokes. My shorter tables tend to deliver
cryptic results designed to shock the reader’s creativity into filling
in the gaps, whereas my longer tables are unusably vast for easy
random generation, being designed to shock the reader’s creativity
into operation by presenting a sea of possibilities.

CREATIVITY
Creativity is the ultimate heart of adventure design; producing a
masterpiece adventure involves many interlocking skills and talents,
but the foremost talent of all is the ability to tap into the depths of
the fantastic imagination and draw forth something startling and
unexpected. Creativity is not an easy skill to teach, but if you’re
reading this book it’s a fair assumption that you’re not in the ranks
of those who truly have difficulties with creative thought. You don’t
need to learn the basics, and you might not even need much help
with the highest reaches of the art. Either way, you know what I
mean when I say that there’s a mindset, a condition of openness,
in which you’re on fire – and when it’s not there, you’re basically
screwed. How do you get into that mindset, where you can grab
ideas from thin air and whisk them together with seeming effortlessness?
Virtually every prominent adventure author I’ve talked with about
this question has answered it in the same way. A creative adventure
begins with a visual image of some kind. It might be dreamlike or
hazy; it might seem, at first, to be nothing of consequence; or it
might leap forth, demanding to be drawn into writing. But it’s quite
clear that a visual image is the most common form of “first inspiration” for an adventure. In my conversations with Rob Kuntz (one of
the foundational authors of Dungeons & Dragons) about creativity,
Rob was quite definite that visual imagery is key to his own first

Traviss Smelser (Order #35989022)

inspirations. Harley Stroh, author of a number of modules for the
Dungeon Crawl Classics line by Goodman Games, agrees. In an interview with Bruce Cordell (Return to the Tomb of Horrors, Sunless
Citadel) on montecook.com, Bruce was asked about his inspiration
for the key monster in one of his modules. The answer? “There was
this old horror movie I saw years ago….”
So, how do we achieve these visual images – “the force that
through the green fuse drives the flower,” as Dylan Thomas might
say? And it’s a question cutting to the whole value of this book itself.
After all, if visual imagery is the key to creativity, isn’t the ideal
creative tool going to be a book of images and pictures rather than a
book of random generation tables?
NO.
“Problems cannot be solved at the same level of consciousness that created
them.” – Albert Einstein
In other words, if I may put my own spin on Einstein’s famous
quote, one visual image doesn’t lead directly to another visual image
except through some other process. The key to creating unique visual images is to tap that other process – and that other process is the
manipulation and recombination of concepts. Let’s look at another
quote from Einstein:
“The physical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain
signs and more-or-less clear images which can be `voluntarily’ reproduced and
combined.”
Again, we’ve got visual images mentioned in the creative mix
Einstein describes; but notice that the key factor is the combination of
“signs” and “images.” Deep creativity is a cloud-realm of diverse
symbols and images; combining and diverging, seeking the unforeseen. And so, in fact, we reach the driving force of this book. To the
fullest extent possible, the tables in the Tome of Adventure Design are
designed to simulate the cloud-realm of deep creativity; to provide
an entry into the disembodied mix of symbols, portents and images
that populate the subconscious mind; to jar the reader – quite artificially – into the creative cloud. And thereby to create a pathway so
that the mind may follow more easily into this strange realm. It’s no
accident that the first cover illustration for this volume focuses upon
opening a doorway.
With all that said, how does one best use this book to enter the
realm of deep creativity? Here’s my advice. First off, whatever
results you roll with your dice, treat the results not as words, but as
pictures, abstracts, concepts, symbols, or meanings. Treat each result
as a half-formed idea, ready for combination with others – leave it to
drift in your mind while you’re accumulating more random results.
And then, once something starts to coalesce – stop rolling dice!
Daydream for a minute, waiting to see if you’ve got something, and
if it isn’t there yet, then start browsing through the tables looking for
whatever “second part” of that idea is going to click it into shape.

Drift, and find.

INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER ONE
This first chapter is about the topmost level of adventure design: a cardinal rule, the elements of a good adventure,
the location, the villain’s plan, and the adventurers’ mission. These all provide context – the framework upon which the
details hang. Oddly – and I’ve had this confirmed to me by several brilliant adventure authors – the context is often not
the starting point for creating an adventure. In many cases, such as Rob Kuntz’s Maure Castle, the “spark” came from a
detail rather than from the context. Rob has written that Maure Castle originated with imagery from a Conan story: the
visual pictures of iron gates and an iron golem. The castle’s history and villains (other than the golem) developed from
those flashes of imagery, not the other way around. There’s no way of knowing whether your creativity will happen to
be working from top-down or from bottom-up, so keep that in mind. If the tables in this book aren’t working for you, try
approaching it in the other direction using tables from later books. In particular, I often use the Monster Tables as an
independent starting point for generating adventure ideas.

ADVENTURE DESIGN:
THE CARDINAL RULE OF
ADVENTURE DESIGN
A good adventure should maximize meaningful player decisions.
An adventure is the setting in which players make decisions
for their characters. It doesn’t matter whether you’re running
a science fiction roleplaying game, an old west roleplaying
game, or a fantasy roleplaying game. Players making decisions
is what it’s all about. From your perspective as the adventure
designer, there are lots of tricks you can use to make a good
adventure into a great adventure, but if you ignore the importance of player decisions you risk making an otherwise good
adventure into a failed gaming experience both for you and
for your players. Thus, the cardinal rule of adventure design:
seek to maximize the number of meaningful, potentially-informed decisions the players can make during the course of
the adventure. By “meaningful,” I mean that the decisions
aren’t just trivial options with no real influence on what’s
going to happen. And by “potentially-informed,” I mean
that the players should have enough information – or the
potential to have gotten that information – to make a good
decision rather than an arbitrary selection between options.
If bad information-gathering or failure to interpret clues is
the reason why the players don’t have all the information they
need, then that’s their problem – it’s a matter of player skill,
and they goofed. But on the other hand, if they play a smart
game, brilliantly gathering information and interpreting clues,
they should encounter your adventure as a series of choices
in which (for the most part) they can use the information to
improve their chances of success as they proceed.

Tactics: a bridge
The tall thought
woven sails, that
flap unfurled above
the tide of hours…

Virtually every “trick” of good adventure design hangs on
this single rule. Maximize meaningful player decisions.

CREATING AN ADVENTURE:
THE ELEMENTS OF A
MASTERPIECE
There are a few distinct components of a good adventure;
even the simplest, most bare-bones adventure should contain
all of these parts. If you’re an experienced game master, at
some point you’ve created tiny little scenarios that somehow
managed to be the most memorable adventures of all time
for your group. And on the other hand, you’ve seen some of
your great creations fall flat. What was the difference? Why
did a scrap of an idea work out so much better than the wellplanned masterpiece? One very good possibility is this: the
scrap of idea happened to contain all of the right components (listed below), and the masterpiece somehow left out
one or more of them. In fact, this is one of the great perils

of the well-constructed adventure. When you’re creating on
the fly, at the gaming table, you dream up new stuff when you
see that something isn’t working right. If you’re working from
an adventure you created ahead of time, you can still fix the
problem during the game, but let’s face it: the whole reason
you wrote your material ahead of time was so you didn’t need
to fix things on the fly.

NECESSARY ELEMENTS OF A MASTERPIECE
ADVENTURE
1) Backstory
2) Location
3) Opposition
4) Variation of Challenge
5) Exploration
6) Race Against Time
7) Resource Management
8) Milestones and Conclusions
9) Continuation Options

BACKSTORY

The backstory is the answer to a question: what happened
to change this location from a normal place into a dangerous
place of adventure, with treasures and monsters? Players love
to discover the answer to this question, and an adventure feels
incomplete, from the players’ perspective, if it ends without
this loose end being tied up. If the backstory is too complicated to be fully discovered or understood, then it’s too complicated for an adventure. Backstory creates the MYSTERY of
the location. It can be as simple as: “A wizard once lived here,
and he died, and monsters moved in.” But an adventure with
absolutely no backstory for the players to discover is like a
play where something isn’t explained by the final curtain. It
leaves a sense of dissatisfaction and incompleteness. Having
some backstory – purely for the purpose of giving the players
something to discover – is actually one of the few tricks of
adventure design that doesn’t come from the cardinal rule of
maximizing player decisions.

LOCATION

The place in which the adventure occurs has to be an
interesting locale, with unusual tactical opportunities and possibly a theme of some kind. The map should be evaluated as
follows: is it a good game board for tactical movement? If the
map doesn’t measure up as a game board, it won’t measure
up for use in a roleplaying game, either. Maps work the same
way in both types of games.

Traviss Smelser (Order #35989022)

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
OPPOSITION

The current occupants of the adventure location might
or might not be related to the backstory. In many cases, the
backstory just explains why the place has become a good
place for monsters to inhabit. In general, monsters need not
all be unusual, but every adventure should contain some sort
of unique monster, and also use those normal monsters in an
interesting way from time to time. Not all monster encounters
must be wildly unusual, either: having the “normal” ones
will highlight the interest of the unusual ones. It’s a matter of
variety.

VARIATION OF CHALLENGE

Players enjoy adventures in which the nature of the challenges they face are varied. A good adventure will include
combats, traps to detect and avoid, strange tricks to figure
out, varied combat terrain, and negotiations. Challenges also
include getting lost (EXPLORATION) and managing limited
resources (RACE AGAINST TIME). A related point is that
obstacles should have variation of solution, as well. Don’t
place challenges that can only be solved in one way – for the
players, making the decision to fight with or to negotiate with
a dragon adds an important dimension to the game.

EXPLORATION

Part of the magic of adventuring is the sense of exploring
a strange place. Getting lost is a serious risk, and the players
will need to create a map of this place in order to return alive.
This aspect of an adventure (especially creating the map
directly at the table) is very powerful for putting the players
directly into the atmosphere, but some gaming groups might
find it tedious. It depends on what you want to emphasize,
and what the players enjoy. Of all the adventure components
listed here, exploration is the only one that isn’t necessarily
universal. With some gaming groups, leaving exploration out
will destroy the feel of the adventure. With others, putting
it in will be seen as a disastrous waste of time. Know your
group.

RACE AGAINST TIME

Whether it’s a major or a minor component of the adventure, some aspect of the adventure must create a race against
time – even if it’s just that the party is running low on money
to pay their bill at the local inn. A race against time is what
causes the players to have to MANAGE RESOURCES.

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Related to the RACE AGAINST TIME, resource management is an important factor in virtually all adventures. In
fact, you don’t have to make any sort of deliberate attempt to
write it into your adventure, because the management of hit
points and spells is built into the game system itself. Indeed,
if you overdo the resource management side of an adven-

ture, you risk bogging things down into nothing more than a
bookkeeping session. For very low-level adventurers, the risk
of running out of torches adds excitement and urgency. But
if you try to focus on torches when the characters are high
level, you’re driving in the wrong gear. Okay, so that’s the
risk of overdoing resource management. On the other hand,
when it’s done right, having a resource to manage can create
a whole new dimension for player decisions, and a memorable
adventure. You’ve done it many times before, possibly without
even thinking about it very much. Here’s an example: a couple of healing potions given to a low-level party as a partial
“up front” payment for a mission. In one sense those potions
are just treasure, and in another sense they’re a way to give
the party an added bit of strength for confronting monsters
that are a bit more interesting than the run of the mill low
level monsters. But you’ve also added a new dimension to
the game: the decision of when to use them. Deliberately
writing a significant element of resource management into
an adventure is probably the riskiest trick in the adventure
designer’s toolbox. When it’s done well, it adds a lot to the
adventure. But you can easily throw off the pace by creating
annoying bookkeeping, or you might accidentally hand out
a resource that can blast away all the adventure’s challenges.
Frankly, this is an art rather than a science. I don’t have any
good guidelines for it other than to say: don’t get too creative
with this unless you’re already an experienced adventure-writer. If you’re relatively inexperienced, just rely upon whatever
resource management challenges are already built into the
game’s rules, and you won’t go far wrong.

MILESTONES AND CONCLUSIONS

The adventure should contain one or more locations where
they can clearly see that they have achieved a victory against
the adventure. These might be places where they learn a
chunk of information about the BACKSTORY, they might
be places where an obviously significant monster dwells, or
they might be mission objectives identified in advance, such
as rescuing prisoners or finding a particular object. Defeating
a “boss” monster is one example of a conclusion, but don’t
make all your adventures follow the pattern of “fight + fight
+ fight + defeat boss monster = conclusion.” The same pattern of milestones and conclusions shouldn’t be repeated too
often, or it gets stale.

CONTINUATION OPTIONS

Something about the MYSTERY, LOCATION, or OPPOSITION gives the adventurers a new direction they might
follow. Avoid creating situations where the players have no
choice about their next course of action. Instead, provide
them with possibilities, hints, clues, and options. A treasure
chest containing a map is the classic example of a continuation option. Nobody’s forced to do anything, but the link to
another adventure is made clearly available.

APPROACH #1: OVERVIEW APPROACH

Tables 1-1A and 1-1B are simply alternates for each other: they provide an overall description of the location, and something/

someone that either currently occupies the location -- or that once gave the location its name, but is not necessarily still there.
Roll independently for each column on the table: the table requires four rolls of d100, not just one!

poral Sanctum of the Insatiable Knight.” These are good starting points for the development of an adventure; enough, at least,
to start putting your mind into gear. You might end up with a location that’s completely different from your initial starting point
once all the pieces have fallen into place, been arranged, and been polished. But that’s the nature of the creative process. Getting
it started is often the hardest step.

APPROACH #2: PURPOSE APPROACH
Table 1-2 below is not used in conjunction with Table 1-1A or 1-1B; it is an alterna-

tive approach to generating seeds for an adventure location. The table is focused more
on the purpose of the location than upon its past or present occupants. This table requires
much more creative thinking than Table 1-1A or 1-1B, because many results will be
quite bizarre at first glance. This is deliberate; without strange conjunctions, tables
don’t yield creative results.

MASTER TABLE OF VILLAINOUS PLANS
Table 1-11: Master Table of Villainous Plans
Die Roll

Type of Villainous Plan (d100)

01-06

Concealment – the villain is trying to conceal himself, to conceal his past acts, conceal his organization,
conceal evidence, etc.

07-13

Conversion – the villain is trying to convert others to his way of thinking (as opposed to subversion, which
involves using them without changing their minds)

14-21

Desecration – the villain seeks to desecrate a location, an item, or an event (desecration could be targeted on
religion or against a tradition)

22-29

Destroy Community – the villain is trying to kill, economically destroy, or otherwise irreparably damage a
particular community (possibly a sub-community or organization). He could have various motives, ranging from
annoyance to following the orders of a greater villain.

30-36

Destroy Good-Aligned Group – the villain seeks to destroy a good-aligned group, either because their
morals offend him, or as the first step in a larger plan

The broken spear

37-43

Economic Power – the villain is working on gaining wealth, either as an end in itself or to fund the next step
in a larger plan

Stone or wood
is worn smooth
from use

44-50

Evoke Catastrophic Event – the villain is trying to set off a natural, magical, psychic, or political disaster.
This might be an end in itself, or the first step in some other plan.

51-57

Food – the villain seeks to get food for himself, a monster, or for his organization. Basic subsistence is the
primary goal of many lesser villains, while reliable food sources for minions can be the objective of more
powerful leaders

58-64

Gain Favor of Another Villain – the villain wants to impress someone. He might be trying to impress his
boss, trying to gain an ally, or showing someone that he’s worthy of employment as a minion.

65-71

Increase Personal Capability – the villain is trying to increase his inherent personal power. This might
include gaining levels of experience, useful information, magic items, etc.

72-78

Political Power – the villain seeks to gain direct or indirect political power at some level of government.

79-81

Random Acts – the villain acts randomly in villainous ways

Shadow clues
Militia
Cleaning supplies
An oak tree

A. CONCEALMENT
Used as a creative tool to generate the start of an adventure, this table gives some details about a villain whose highest priority
at the moment is to simply to hide himself (itself) or the evidence of another plan (past, present, or future). Most likely, this is only
the first step in his grand scheme, but it might be a clean-up operation from a different plan that has just finished for good or ill.
The table is primarily for intelligent mastermind-types; if you’ve already got an unintelligent monster in mind, assume that it’s
building a hidden lair of some sort or roll on the Food-Related Activities table.

Assassination. The Villain is targeting anyone who could identify him from a past
identity he wants to keep secret, or is killing those who know about his plans. In other
words, the villain might be trying to conceal himself or his activities; these aren’t always
the same. A villain engaged in secret activities might be completely certain he can’t be
identified, but still worried that his plot could be uncovered. Assassinations might be the last
resort when a villainous plot is already starting to fall apart. The villain’s minions might be
his targets, too, if things have gone badly and the villain is concealing his tracks.

Eliminating Evidence (damage control). The villain is trying to eliminate evidence of a
plan or crime that failed, and that he has written off. He might be taking several actions at
once: killing his own minions that were involved, killing witnesses, stealing documents and
other evidence, etc.
Eliminating Evidence (mopping up). The villain is eliminating evidence of a plan or
crime that has succeeded – covering his tracks, in other words. If he up a usurper on the
throne (to choose one example), he might still need to kill the minion or dupe who poisoned
the true king. Or, he might need to change some historical records that could reveal the
usurper’s non-noble pedigree. Most crimes leave evidence behind.
Frame-up. The villain is framing another person (or monster) for a crime he committed
himself. The target might be a minion, an innocent bystander the villain dislikes, or a
monster such as a nearby dragon (dragons being excellent fall-guys for arsonists). Remember
also: from the villain’s perspective, the enemy of his enemy is not his friend – he’s a potential
fall guy.
Lair-Building (rural). The villain is building a concealed lair to hide himself and his
activities from the group indicated in column 1. This could be the activity of a mindless
monster (in which case column 1 is irrelevant), or it might be part of the thought-out plan of
a relatively intelligent mastermind.

From Whom

How He’s Concealing It

Former victim

Lair-Building (urban or village). The villain is building a hidden lair within a civilized
community. Again, this could be the instinctive action of an unintelligent beast (such as a
giant spider nesting in an attic, or a ghoul making tunnels under a cemetery) or might be the
first step in a mastermind’s plan (e.g., an evil priest digging a secret basement-complex).

61-70

Group of
former allies

Organization (façade). The villain is creating an organization of innocent-looking
minions in plain sight, but with a secret agenda for the group. The organization might be
a cover story for existing minions (yes, we are all circus performers!) or it might be a way
of recruiting unsuspecting locals to join. In this sort of operation, the villain is primarily
trying to conceal the organization’s secret operations rather than to conceal himself; he
might even be a prominent citizen of the town or village where the organization is being
created. His plan might include recruiting people away from the local community to a rural
“temple” or “lodge,” or the organization’s base might be located right in the middle of the
community (for example, an innocent-looking store that actually fences stolen goods brought
in by caravan from the nearby city). To determine the organization’s secret agenda, you
might want to roll again on the Master Table. Note that this sort of plan is almost certainly
the agenda of an intelligent villain, even if the operation is run by a minion with lower
intelligence.

71-80

Local
authorities or
militia

Organization (secret). The villain is creating a secret organization of minions, meeting in
secret with no cover story for their activities. This could be a secret cult, a plan to overthrow
the government, or the unification of wererat tribes in the sewer tunnels of a large city.
Secret societies can take many forms if you’re creative.

81-90

Local
authorities or
militia

Secret identity (establishing). The villain is disguised within the human population, and is
building up a new identity for himself. He might have forged documents, or an altered body
form. In this case, the villain has created a new identity – if he has taken someone’s place,
see below for comments.

Local
authorities or
militia

Secret Identity (learning). The villain has replaced a human in the community, and is
learning the details of his new identity. This is not a strategy limited to shape-changing
villains; anyone can pretend to be someone from far away. The villain might be making
some blunders as he impersonates the dead or absent target – he might not know, for
example, that the king was a vegetarian, or where the merchant hid the key to his treasure
room.

B. CONVERSION
Conversion-type plans are designed to win over the hearts, minds, and possibly souls of the villain’s targets. There is another
similar table later on called “Subversion,” and the distinction is that a conversion plot is designed to change the moral alignment
of the target, whereas a subversion plot can succeed perfectly well if the target never changes at all – as long as the target keeps

Conversion Method (d100)

01-05

Addiction. The villain uses peoples’ addictions to get them to take evil actions

06-10

Bad Advice. The villain advises people to engage in evil actions, working from some position of authority
he has already obtained (e.g., a good priest, a military leader, a city alderman, a prosecutor, etc). The villain
might be giving insidious advice to the population at large (by preaching war, for example), or he might be in the
position of an adviser to a noble, a guildmaster, or some other powerful person. The “evil vizier” of Arabian
folklore is a prime example of this sort of villain.

Table 1-13: Conversion continued
Die Roll

Conversion Method (d100)

11-15

Blackmail. The villain is blackmailing people into committing evil actions. These actions might or might not
actually change their alignments, depending in how you use alignment in your game.

16-20

Debts. The villain is a moneylender or has control of money (a local exchequer or military quartermaster,
perhaps) and is using peoples’ debts to force them into undertaking evil actions.

21-25

Demonic Gifts. The villain gives “gifts” of a demon’s assistance. Eventually, the victim becomes reliant or
even addicted to such help, and falls into the villain’s (or the demon’s) clutches as a helpless pawn.

26-30

Enchantment. The villain is magically charming people, then persuading or ordering them to commit evil
actions.

31-35

Hostages. The villain takes hostages, compelling their kin or the hostages themselves to perform evil actions in
exchange for freedom or good treatment.

36-40

Magic. The villain uses magical means (using an item, probably) to change the alignment of his victims. The
effect might only work from long-term exposure to the item, or it might be instantaneous.

41-45

Persuasion. The silver-tongued devil is able to convert people to his cause by words alone. This might be
through religious conversions, or by persuading people to take specifically evil actions. This is the “tempter”
type of villain common in European morality tales (eve and the serpent, Marlowe and Goethe’s versions of the
Doctor Faustus story, etc.)

46-50

Money. The villain simply pays people to take evil actions.

51-55

Obligations of Honor. The villain is using peoples’ open-ended promises and oaths as a means of getting
evil actions done. The fictionalized mafia of the Godfather movies is an excellent example: by doing a favor
in exchange for another, unspecified, favor in the future, the villain can force people to undertake tasks they
wouldn’t have agreed to ahead of time if they had known what would be required of them.

56-60

Minions Give Bad Advice. The villain’s minions advise evil actions from positions of authority. The plan
is basically the same as “Bad Advice” above, but performed by the villain’s minions instead of by the villain
himself. The villain remains one step removed from the dirty work, possibly more anonymous than someone in
a position to be giving advice.

As much as you can

61-65

Minions Take Hostages. The villain’s minions hold hostages to compel evil actions from the hostage’s
friends or kin. This is like the “Hostages” entry above, but the minions are the ones on the front line. As always,
the weakness in the plan is that if you want something done right, you need to do it yourself.

The moon shows

66-70

Minions Use Addictions. The villain’s minions use peoples’ addictions to get them to take evil actions. The
minions might be supplying people with addictive substances, might be taking over the operations of existing
suppliers by force or guile, or might be blackmailing people (assuming the drugs are illegal).

71-75

Minions Use Blackmail. Similar to the “Blackmail” plot, but the villain’s minions are blackmailing people
into performing evil actions rather than the villain himself.

76-80

Minions Use Enchantment. The villain’s minions are charming people to get them to perform evil actions.
This might be the same as “Enchantment” above, but it might be that the villain himself doesn’t have the
magical capability to enchant people. If the villain’s minion is able to use such magic, and the villain isn’t, keep
in mind that the minion might have his own secret agenda.

81-85

Minions Use Magic. The villain’s minions are directly changing peoples’ moral alignment with the use of
magic – whether this is an inherent capability or by the use of a powerful magic item (or even an artifact). As
with all minion-type plans, the minions might be slightly incompetent, or might be intelligent enough to have
their own agenda.

Minions Use Money. The villain’s minions pay people to undertake evil actions. This is only different from
“subversion” in that the actions are presumably heinous enough to cause a possible change in alignment.

91-95

Minions Use Obligations of Honor. The villain has a minion who is a feudal lord, a crime boss, or
who holds some other station in which people make open-ended promises to him. At the villain’s request or
command, the minion is able to take advantage of these open-ended promises to extort actions people would
never directly have agreed to.

96-00

Minions Use Persuasion. The villain’s minions persuade people into a religious or moral conversion to evil
(or Chaos, depending upon the campaign). Most likely, the villain has the minion doing the job because the
villain lacks the charisma (or the human appearance) to pull it off.

C. DESECRATION
In a desecration-type plot, the villain seeks to destroy, subvert, or render meaningless an important location (usually a religious
site) or an event (not always religious). Table 1-14 is used when the villain intends to desecrate a location (50% chance), and
Tables 1-15 and 1-16 are used if the target is an event (50% chance).

Conquest. Villain plans to conquer and occupy the holy site by military assault; using a frontal attack,
infiltration, or the help of a traitor.

11-20

Nullification From Afar. The villain plans to counteract the power of a holy site with activities he can
perform in another location. Examples might include such things as building a dark mirror-image location as
a counteracting force, or summoning clouds to hang permanently over a sun temple. Possibilities for this are
pretty vast.

21-30

Raze it to the Ground. The villain plans to physically destroy a temple or holy site using an earthquake,
burning it, exploding it, or using some other implement of physical destruction other than a frontal assault.

31-40

Seed of Evil. The villain plans to desecrate the temple or holy site by planting an unholy object on the
premises, probably in a hidden place (but also, possibly, substituting something in plain sight with a duplicate).
He might replace the eye of an idol with the eye of a demon, perhaps he might bury the body of a hanged
murderer under the altar, or perhaps a stone soaked in the cursed waters of La’aashoon might be used to
replace a flagstone.

41-50

Stealing the Relics. The villain plans to steal or modify the specific holy item that gives a temple or a holy
site its power or significance. He might be planning to replace it with a worthless forgery, or he might plan just
to hide it away. This is a good plot to introduce two levels of villain – the one who is supposed to arrange the
actual theft, and a more powerful master who plans to use or destroy the relic.

51-60

Target the Congregation. The villain plans to subvert or convert the temple’s congregation into attacking
the priests or otherwise destroying the temple or holy site.

61-70

Target the Priesthood (Guile). The villain plans to eliminate or remove the servants of a holy site by
trickery, then occupy, desecrate, or destroy the site. He might do so by impersonating a messenger from the high
priesthood calling the priests away to an emergency conclave, perhaps. A nearby “natural” disaster might also
be used as the decoy.

Target the Priesthood (Stealth). The villain plans to eliminate the servants of a holy site by stealthy means,
allowing him to occupy, desecrate, or destroy the site at leisure. He might even keep the site open for business
afterwards! This sort of plot might include assassinations, kidnappings, disguised replacements for the missing
priests, or man other kinds of nefarious doings.

Wrath of the Wings

81-90

Target the Priesthood (Subvert). The villain plans to subvert the priesthood to evil, and use them to
desecrate the temple. For ideas about his methods, you might want to take a look at the “Conversion” and
“Subversion” tables (Table 1-13 and Table 1-32)

91-00

Unholy Event. The villain plans to desecrate the temple or holy site by causing some unholy action to
take place there. Examples might include a human sacrifice, the speaking of ancient or blasphemous words,
summoning a demon within the precincts, or a formal rededication of the temple to an evil deity. Most such
plots would require someone to get into the site, although it might not need to be the villain himself.

Intended Method of Destruction (d100)

01-05

Anger the Protector. The plan is to cause the community’s destruction by getting a significant protector of
the village to depart, leaving the community at the mercy of predators (including the villain). The protector
might be a knight, a powerful cleric, or some other person. The methods might include framing this protector
for crimes, spreading rumors about him, or impersonating him while committing crimes. Virtually any sort of
activity designed to besmirch a person’s reputation might be used.

06-10

Arson. The villain plans to burn everything to the ground, either directly or with the help of a firebug minion.

11-15

Attack! The villain has enough military resources to attack and destroy the community – possibly missing just
one key factor.

16-20

Eviction. The villain is (legally) evicting members of the community by using his influence with the legal
system, influence with rulers, false facts, framed evidence of crimes, diverting taxes from reaching tax collectors,
etc. This is the “evil landlord” type of villain who makes an appearance in many of the Brothers Grimm fairy
tales.

21-25

26-30

Harbor the Menace. The villain plans to (or has already started to) provide a safe lair for a predatory killer,
monster, murderer, trapper, arsonist, etc. The dangerous inhabitant might have been brought in, found and
adopted, or actually created by the villain.
Interdiction or Siege. This sort of plot could include any sort of interdiction of supply or demand. The
“standard” use of this plot as an adventure device is a military blockade or siege; bandits cutting off the road
to a village, or the siege of a fortification. However, there are many subtler ways to use this sort of plot as well.
Blessings or information might be the “commodity” that’s being cut off rather than the more obvious food and
trade. The villain might, for example, have manipulated the local high priest into refusing to perform religious
ceremonies, or might have captured him. The interdiction might be limited to a particular commodity, such
as the iron needed for a blacksmithing operation in a local castle. Causing the iron to rust while it’s in transit
is an example of interdiction bearing no resemblance to a straightforward siege. Let your mind roam free for
possibilities – this is a plot with lots of scope for GM creativity.

Murder. The villain (or a deadly minion) is killing the community one at a time, the old fashioned way. This
could be a straightforward psycho killer or other human-hater on the loose, or it could be a much more intricate
plot: watch Tim Burton’s film version of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (the one with Johnny Depp) for a really
complex example.

36-40

Plague. The villain plans to spread a plague, or is somehow maintaining an existing plague. This might
be done with mundane means such as putting rotting meat into a water supply, it might be a magical plague
maintained with the help of a god of disease, or it might be a magic-user casting uniquely-crafted spells.

41-45

Poison. The villain is poisoning something: water, food, air, animals, crops, clothing, etc.

46-50

Prepare for Battle. The villain is hiring or assembling troops (possibly monstrous) for a direct military
assault. The troops might not yet be well enough trained, or might not be numerous enough for the invasion to
begin.

51-55

Provoke Invasion by Impersonation. The villain seeks to provoke someone else into invading the
community. He is doing so by impersonating members of the community while committing crimes, treason,
immoral acts, etc. This could be as large-scale as committing raids against one baron’s villages under the flag of
another baron.

56-60

Provoke Invasion by Lies. The villain seeks to provoke an invasion by spreading rumors and lies about the
community (e.g., the village is a hideout for bandits, a guild is plotting the overthrow of the king, a village is
harboring a traitor, etc.).

61-65

Remove Skilled Leader. The villain wants to remove a skilled leader – not a protector, but someone whose
services are vital to the community. Examples might include a well-known swordsmith, a druid who blesses
the crops, or someone who gives wise counsel. The means of removal might include violence, provoking the
community to exile the leader, or poisoning the leader’s opinion of the community.

66-70

Remove/Destroy Protective Item. The villain’s target is some item that protects the community; he plans
to steal it, destroy it, or nullify its effects.

71-75

Sabotage Source of Income. The villain has a cunning plan to destroy the market for the community’s
product. He might plan to poison the product, sabotage its quality, spread rumors about it, etc.

76-80

Sabotage the Food Source. The villain is eliminating domestic animals or crops, possibly by poison, possibly
by slaughter, or perhaps by theft. He might be calling in predators using some magical capability.

81-85

Smuggle in Beasts. The villain is in the process of enticing, luring, or importing monsters into the area. This
could be a plot involving changelings, shape-shifters, or some other subtlety – or it might be that the villain’s
making a dragon-calling whistle.

86-90

Spread Dissention. The villain plans to set members of the community violently against each other by
spreading lies and rumors. This is the Iago-type villain of Shakespeare’s Othello, who puts the right word in the
right ear, spreading hatred and distrust where there was originally friendship and mutual alliance.

91-95

Traps. The villain is setting traps around or in the community. His intention might be to kidnap, or the traps
might be lethal.

96-00

Wild West Chaos. The villain is engaging in widespread robbery and burglary, probably with the help of
minions. Here, the villain’s goal is either to take control of the community when law and order break down, or
simply to bleed it dry in an orgy of violence and theft.

Anyone who was present at a particular religious ritual
held in the recent past

Indirect murders by poison or traps. Generally
this will involve enticing community members to a
particular location, or targeting a place where the
members meet.

41-45

Apprentices or henchmen of a powerful good-aligned
individual such as a good wizard. To make this unclear
at the outset, the initial targets might be the apprentices
of the original apprentices.

G. EVOKE CATASTROPHIC EVENT
Evoking catastrophic events is a common theme for villains. Generally adventures focused on this sort of villain will involve
discovery of the plot and an attempt to prevent the catastrophe. Since in most cases the catastrophe hasn’t yet taken place, the
table focuses mainly on the missing element the villain hasn’t yet completed. In some cases, the nature of the villain’s plot might
not be known ahead of time – in other words, the party might discover the villain’s plot after attacking his stronghold for a different reason (treasure, usually).

Minions and villains have to eat, just like everyone else. This is the best table to use if you’ve already decided that your key
monster is non-intelligent or really stupid, but it works even for the subtlest masterminds, too.

06-10

The villain/monster feeds on people from a hidden place in civilization (does not need to resemble a human,
but might)

11-15

The villain/monster has allies nearby that need to be fed. He (or they) steals people, vegetables and grain, or
livestock by means of luring them away or kidnapping them. This sort of approach is taken by a wide variety of

The villain/monster feeds on people in a way that leaves them alive for future feedings (e.g., parasite or other).
The food source could be souls, blood, morale, ability scores, or even emotions such as jealously.

46-50

The villain/monster feeds on people in a way that leaves them alive for future feedings, but not directly. In
addition, the villain must process the vital essences before eating them. The “processing” is an extra step in the
cycle.

METHOD OF GAINING POLITICAL POWER

Table 1-27: Method of Gaining Political Power
Die Roll

Method (d100)

01

Assassinate Leader with Accident. Villain is a leader’s direct heir or is the second in command of a
hierarchy, and is planning to assassinate the leader by creating an accident.

A meeting of
monsters

02

Assassinate Leader with Assassins. Villain is a leader’s direct heir or second in command of a hierarchy,
and is planning to hire assassins to remove the annoying impediment.

Line of light

03

Behind the Throne – Criminal Power. Villain is building up a criminal organization to take over effective
control of the targeted political organization, turning the existing source of authority into a mere figurehead.

04

Behind the Throne – Magical Domination. Villain is planning to dominate the organization’s king or
boss using magic, turning him into a puppet leader.

05

Behind the Throne – Magical Friendship. Villain is preparing to charm the leader using magic (as
opposed to utterly dominating his will).

06

Behind the Throne – Military. Villain has enough forces to influence the leader’s policies already, and is
directing the organization’s activities behind the scenes to his own advantage. The villain threatens (subtly or
not) that if the leader does not accede to the villain’s demands, the villain will use his troops to usurp authority.

07

Behind the Throne – Minion Shapechanger. Villain’s minion is using shapechanging of some sort to
impersonate a kidnapped rival, or even the leader of the organization.

08

Behind the Throne – Simulacrum. Villain seeks to replace the political leader or a rival for power with a
simulacrum he controls.

09

Blackmail Rival – Lies. Villain seeks to blackmail a rival with trumped-up facts.

10

Blackmail Rival – Truth. Villain seeks to blackmail a rival with true facts.

11

Build up Favors. Villain is in control of the police or has the power to prosecute crimes. He is using this
power to make various powerful people indebted to him, so that when he makes his move for power they will
support him.

12

Control Food Supply – Contamination. Villain plans to gain control of the food supply by stashing food
stocks and then contamination everyone else’s.

13

Control Food Supply – Dietary Restrictions. Villain plans to gain control of the food supply by creating
a hidden stash of a particular type of food, then imposing dietary restrictions on other kinds of food using
religion, law, or heavy taxes.

14

Control Legal System – Bribes. Villain is trying to take control of the legal system in the target area by
bribing judges. Note: almost all organizations have some sort of legal system for resolving disputes – this plot
works for guilds and other organizations as well as cities and baronies.

15

Control Legal System – Intimidate Judges. Villain is trying to take control of the legal system in the
target area by blackmailing or threatening judges. This works well for a villain who is the leader of a criminal
underground, but can be used for any size or type of political organization.

16

Control Legal System – Replace Judges. Villain is trying to take control of the legal system in the
target area by replacing independent judges with his own minions. His methods could include impeachment,
assassination, rigged elections, or subverting/recruiting the existing judges. He will likely need to use several
methods in order to conceal the fact that lots of judges are suddenly stepping down or disappearing under
strange circumstances.

Die Roll

17

Method (d100)
Control Work Assignments. Villain seeks to control the assignment of jobs, giving them only to his
supporters. This works well for a villain who is already in a position of some power – a guildmaster, a treasurer,
or a labor leader, for instance. This sort of plot could affect jobs in areas as large as a kingdom or as small
as a village, and the nature of the organization could range from royal courts to thieves guilds to religious
organizations.

18

Coup d’Etat. Villain is planning a coup d’etat from the inside, with the help of allies in the community or
organization.

19

Create Power Vacuum – Trap. Villain is creating a trap that will kill much of the leadership (collapsing the
town hall, for example), and let him take charge when there is no one else offering effective leadership.

20

Discredit Superior Officer – False Accusations. Villain plans to spread a rumor to his own leader’s
superior, indicating that his leader is involved in treachery.

21

Discredit Superior Officer – False Accusations to followers. Villain plans to spread a rumor to the
public at large (or to troops, or other followers) that his superior officer is engaged in unsuitable behavior.

22

Discredit Superior Officer – Inciting. Villain plans to set his superior officer up for failure by creating and
inciting particular situations the superior officer is supposed to prevent from happening.

23

Discredit Superior Officer – Information. Villain plans to set his superior officer up for failure by giving
away vital information about the superior officer’s operations and plans. This will allow the leader’s enemies or
rivals to continually outwit and outperform the leader (until the villain, as his junior, is asked to take the post).

24

Discredit Superior Officer – Sabotage. Villain plans to set his superior officer up for failure by sabotaging
his operations.

25

Dominate population – Addictions. The villain is using an addictive substance (or an addictive event or
experience) to bring members of the population under his thrall.

26

Dominate Population – Mental Domination. The villain is setting up an event that will have a
tremendously powerful magical or mental effect, rendering everyone in the vicinity malleable to the villain’s will.

27

Eliminate Advisor with Assassins. The villain is an advisor to the leader (not second in command), and is
eliminating other advisers. Current method for eliminating the next adviser is to have him assassinated.

28

Eliminate Advisor with Frame-up – Crime. The villain is an advisor to the leader (not second in
command), and is eliminating other advisers. Current method for eliminating the next adviser is to frame him
for a crime actually committed by the villain.

29

Eliminate Advisor with Frame-up – Adultery. The villain is an advisor to the leader (not second in
command), and is eliminating other advisers. Current method for eliminating the next adviser is to frame him
for committing adultery (possibly with the top leader’s wife)

30

Eliminate Advisor with Frame-up - Lying. The villain is an advisor to the leader (not second in
command), and is eliminating other advisers. Current method for eliminating the next adviser is to frame him
for lying to the top leader (or some other serious lie)

31

Eliminate Advisor with Frame-up – Cowardice. The villain is an advisor to the leader (not second in
command), and is eliminating other advisers. Current method for eliminating the next adviser is to frame him
for cowardice.

32

Eliminate Current Commander – Frame-up for Crime. Villain is not yet an heir or second in
command, but is working his way up the chain (if he has been committing crimes to do so this might be a reason
why the party is getting involved). He plans to eliminate his current commander by framing him for a crime the
villain has already committed.

Eliminate Current Commander – Frame-up for Adultery. Villain is not yet an heir or second in
command, but is working his way up the chain (if he has been committing crimes to do so this might be a reason
why the party is getting involved). He plans to eliminate his current commander by framing him for adultery.

34

Eliminate Current Commander – Frame-up for Cowardice. Villain is not yet an heir or second in
command, but is working his way up the chain (if he has been committing crimes to do so this might be a reason
why the party is getting involved). He plans to eliminate his current commander by framing him for cowardice.

35

Eliminate Current Commander – Frame-up for Dishonor. Villain is not yet an heir or second in
command, but is working his way up the chain (if he has been committing crimes to do so this might be a reason
why the party is getting involved). He plans to eliminate his current commander by framing him for some
dishonorable act – lying, for instance.

36

Eliminate Current Leader – Insanity. The villain is somehow causing insanity in the leader so he can
shake up the hierarchy to his own advantage. He is not necessarily the heir to power, but he expects that his
position will be significantly advanced by the leader’s removal.

37

Eliminate Rival – Magical Domination. The villain is planning to magically dominate a rival, turning
him into a fall guy, causing him to resign, causing him to advance the villain in the hierarchy, etc.

38

Eliminate Rival – Magical Friendship. The villain is preparing to charm a rival into becoming his friend
and ally, although the villain does not have enough power to completely dominate the rival.

39

Fake Miracles. The villain is fooling people into believing that he is performing wonders (these are actually
staged events, staged attacks, staged healing, etc.). Note that these are not necessarily magical miracles – they
might be military “victories” against the villain’s own forces, for instance.

40

False Claim – Dynastic Succession. Villain plans to establish a false (or perhaps even real) claim to
power based on the villain’s family tree. Villain’s purported ancestors were overthrown by the current leader’s
ancestors. This is probably done with forged documents “proving” ancestry or with a last testament and will.

41

False Claim – Family Succession. Villain plans to establish a false (or perhaps even real) claim to power
based on the leader’s family tree (as opposed to the villain’s). Supposedly, leader’s ancestor was adopted and
named as the heir, while villain’s real or purported ancestor actually had the right by primogeniture. Or vice
versa. This is probably done with forged documents.

42

False Defense – Leader’s Base. The villain will stage an attack on a superior officer’s base of power, and
be in the right place at the right time to “defend” it from his own attack (the fight might be staged, or might be
real), and thereby earn his superior officer’s gratitude.

43

False Defense – Leader’s Family. The villain will stage an attack on a superior officer’s family, and be in
the right place at the right time to “defend” the family from the attack, thereby earning the superior officer’s
gratitude.

44

False Defense – Leader’s Home Community. The villain will stage an attack on a superior officer’s home
community while the leader is away, placing himself in the right place at the right time to “defend” it from his
own attack. He hopes to gain the leader’s gratitude from the successful defense.

45

False Identity – Higher Authority (minion). Villain’s minion is posing as the representative of a higher
authority (religious, feudal, etc) and is delivering “orders” to the leader. The imposture could be accomplished
with shapechanging, forged documents, or sheer bravado.

Method (d100)
False Identity – Higher Authority (villain). The villain is posing as the representative of a higher
authority (religious, feudal, etc) and is delivering “orders” to the leader. The imposture could be accomplished
with shapechanging, forged documents, or sheer bravado.
Financial Scheme – Debt and Foreclosure. The villain plans to put a rival into monetary debt to the
villain. This could be done by a combination of financial scams and with the help of moneylenders who are
a front for the villain. He might also be buying the rival’s debts from moneylenders. Foreclosure or gaining
influence through the threat of foreclosure might be the leverage he plans to achieve.
Financial Scheme – Identity Theft. The villain is trying to create a financial disaster for one of his rivals,
such as an equal rival, a superior officer, or even the top leader in the chain of command. His method is to
use the opponent’s identity to borrow money and incur debts in the opponent’s name. The villain, of course,
benefits twice: he not only eliminates his rival, but also he gets the fraudulently obtained cash.

49

Financial Scheme – Scams. The villain is trying to create a financial disaster for one of his rivals by
targeting them directly with financial scams. Probably the villain is trying to pocket the money from the scams,
too.

50

Financial Scheme – Theft. The villain is trying to create a financial disaster for one of his rivals by stealing
the rival’s money.

51

Impersonation – Heir. The villain plans to pose as a lost or missing heir (possibly one that became lost or
missing through the villain’s efforts).

52

Impersonation – Shapechanging. The villain is using shapechanging of some kind to impersonate a
kidnapped rival, or even the leader of the organization.

53

Infiltration – Mental. Villain is in control of guards or other military force, and is corrupting their minds
with charm, hypnosis, unbelievable charisma, etc. His goal is to use them as the shock troops for some sort of
coup attempt.

54

Infiltration – Purge. The villain is (or has been) infiltrating troops, monsters, etc. into the community where
the organization is based, planning for a sudden and coordinated purge of his rivals.

55

Infiltration – Takeover. The villain is (or has been) infiltrating troops, monsters, etc. into the community
where the organization is based, planning for a sudden and coordinated takeover of key locations.

56

Kidnap Rival. The villain seeks to kidnap a rival. The goal is to get information, get the hostage to write
letters that help the villain, etc.

57

Kidnap Rival’s Family. The villain seeks to take a rival’s family or friends hostage to influence the rival’s
actions.

58

Manipulate Omens Against Rival. The villain plans to manipulate omens to suggest that his rival is evil or
unsuitable for command.

59

Manipulate Omens for Self. The villain plans to manipulate omens to suggest that he (or his minion) is the
best choice for something, the rightful leader, the only hope, etc.

60

Marry Heir – Magical Domination. The villain plans to seduce the top leader’s daughter (or son, as
applicable) by using charm, hypnotism, love potions, etc. This part of the plot may already have occurred,
putting the player characters into the position of having to stop the marriage or otherwise foil the plot.

61

Marry Heir – Seduction. The villain plans to gain the position of heir to political power by marrying
one of the leader’s children. The villain is using traditional means to do so (presumably this is a villain with
tremendous charisma).

Die Roll

The wrong clothes

62

Military Conquest. The villain has (or is building) enough military power (outside the community) to make a
direct military conquest. This is fairly straightforward.

63

Military Interdiction. The villain is using military power to cut off supplies or exports – this is the classic
brigand-villain who starves his enemies into submission and is given power when they surrender. In a more
abstract sense, a sinister merchant could use a financial version of this scheme against a guild or another
merchant, using thieves, bandits, and pirates to stop their exports and trade.

64

Military Intimidation. The villain is building up a military force inside or outside the organization/
community, planning to reach the point where his military power is enough to allow him to influence policy.

65

Military Takeover – Circumventing Defenses. The villain has military power of his own, but his real
project is to circumvent the target’s defenses. In the case of a fortification, this could include digging a secret
tunnel beneath the walls; in other cases, it could be a preparation to poison or incapacitate defenders, hire a
traitor to open the gates, etc.

66

Military Takeover – Removing Key People. The villain has military power and is ready to attack. His
first step is to remove a few key people of power who represent a military threat to him. Note: in addition to
controlling a government, this plot could also be applied to the takeover of a guild by means of a purge – the
strongest guild members and their adventurer friends might be the targets of the purge.

67

Military Takeover – Stealing Key. The villain has military power, but is working on weakening the defenses
of the target. His immediate method is to steal a key or password that gives him access to the defensive item.
The item might be magical, or it might be, say, the password that lets people into the area where the catapults
are located (so that they can be sabotaged just before the attack).

68

Military Takeover – War of Attrition. The villain has military power, but is working on weakening the
defenses of his target by ambushing enemy soldiers or guards before the actual assault, thus reducing their
numbers.

69

Minion Seduces Heir. The villain has a minion or an ally who is seducing the heir. The minion could
possibly be a supernatural creature, such as a succubus.

70

Mob Charisma. By sheer force of charisma, the villain is whipping the population into a frenzy, preparing to
mount a popular takeover in a series of riots.

71

Murder Own Powerful Spouse. The villain is married to the leader already, who is now his only
impediment to absolute power.

72

Murder Threats. Villain threatens to kill people in the general population one day at a time until the leader
surrenders control. Unless he is acting with a secret identity, the villain is either very powerful or very insane to
think he can hold onto power after taking it this way – but perhaps he’s right. If he is not acting with a secret
identity, he likely has a hidden stronghold to protect himself from attempts to stop him.

73

Overt Curse for Control. Villain has cursed the leader, one of the leader’s main followers, or a member of
the leader’s family. Everyone knows that the villain created the curse. The villain will only remove the curse if
the leader steps down in favor of the villain.

74

Party Misdirected. The “villain” is the good guy, and the leader is the bad guy, but this is not clear at the
outset of the adventure.

75

Pied Piper Strategy – Heirship. The villain controls monsters or predators that are attacking everywhere
in the general population. The villain offers to get rid of them if he is made the leader’s heir (he probably won’t
reveal that he started the problem in the first place).

authority (he probably won’t reveal that he started the problem in the first place).

78

Pied Piper Strategy – Total Control. The villain controls monsters or predators that are attacking
everywhere in the general population. The villain offers to get rid of them if he is given control (he probably
won’t reveal that he started the problem in the first place).

Something was left
behind

Prepared Purge. The villain is working on assembling all of his rivals into a specific, vulnerable location for
a single, decisive strike. As the foundation for an adventure, the characters might have been hired as security
for the event, as a bodyguard, or might stumble onto the plot before the strike takes place. Conversely, this plot
could be used as a back story to explain why the characters have just entered a community thrown into chaos by
a successful purge.

80

Prosecute Rivals. The villain is in control of the police, or has the power to prosecute crimes. He is using
this power to eliminate his rivals, investigating them or charging them with crimes.

The time had come

81

Replace Key Leaders. The villain is replacing key members of the population with shapeshifting minions
who will support him when he makes his bid for power.

82

Rig Election for Ally. The villain is rigging an election to get a friend or ally elected into a position of power.
The position might be a village alderman, the chancellor of the exchequer, judge, master of the revels, etc.

83

Rig Election for Minion. The villain is rigging an election to get one of his minions elected to a position of
power.

84

Rig Election for Self. The villain is rigging an election to get himself elected into a position of power.

85

Rig Vote Against Rival – Financial. The villain is rigging a vote in favor of a law that will create problems
for a rival if the law is passed – it will create oppressive taxes on the rival’s (but not the villain’s) main source of
income, as one example.

86

Rig Vote Against Rival – Status and Standing. The villain is rigging a vote in favor of a law that will
create problems for a rival if the law is passed. It will make the rival ineligible to hold his current office.
Examples include votes that require a minimum financial resources, require that the office holder has never been
arrested for drunkenness, require that the office holder be a member of a particular bloodline or ancestry, etc.

Secret Curse for Heirship. The villain has cursed the leader, one of the leader’s main followers, or a
member of the leader’s family. It is not known who created the curse, but the villain will offer to remove the
curse if he is declared the rightful heir to power. This is very similar to the Pied Piper strategy.

88

Secret Curse for Position of Authority. The villain has cursed the leader, one of the leader’s main
followers, or a member of the leader’s family. It is not known who created the curse, but the villain will offer to
remove the curse if he is granted a position of authority (possibly a very minor one).

Secret Curse for Total Control. The villain has cursed the leader, one of the leader’s main followers, or
a member of the leader’s family. It is not known who created the curse, but the villain will offer to remove the
curse if he is acclaimed as the new leader (this is unlikely to work if the target is a governmental organization
but might work very well in a financial organization such as a guild).

90

Secret Curse to Marry Heir. The villain has cursed the leader, one of the leader’s main followers, or a
member of the leader’s family. It is not known who created the curse, but the villain will offer to remove the
curse if he is allowed to marry the heiress.

91

Seize Key Location and Interdict. The villain plans to seize a stronghold that controls supply or access
to the targeted area, whereupon he will simply demand that the current leader surrender power. This is a
preparation for a Military Interdiction, although the key feature is to improve that gambit with possession of the
stronghold.

92

Sends Anti-Rival Dreams. The villain has the ability to influence another person’s dreams, and is
broadcasting them to suggest that his rival is a bad person or otherwise unsuitable. The method used might be
a magic item, a minion with this supernatural ability, or possibly influencing dreams in one of the villain’s own
inherent powers.

93

Send Pro-Villain Dreams. The villain has the ability to influence another person’s dreams, and is
broadcasting them to suggest that he or his minion should be in charge. The method used might be a magic
item, a minion with this supernatural ability, or possibly influencing dreams in one of the villain’s own inherent
powers.

94

Take Symbol of Authority. The villain is trying to take control of a particular symbol of authority (a crown,
scepter, etc) that actually conveys the authority he seeks. This might be a tradition that has expired, but which
could still be a big problem for the existing leader. As an example: “Whosoever holds the Sword of Karnak is
the rightful king of Karnakland…”

95

Threat to Unleash Catastrophe. The villain has set things up (and must be able to prove it) so that he
can unleash a catastrophe. Unless the leader surrenders control by a specific time, the villain will cause the
catastrophe to take place.

96

Threaten Food Shortage. The villain controls the area’s food supply, and threatens to cut it off if he is
not granted a position of authority. Note that this might be a permissible and legal threat if the villain is a
baron who supplies a town with food – or it might be completely illegal if the villain is an orcish chief who has
conquered the nearby countryside.

97

Threaten Labor Shortage. Villain is in enough of a position of economic power that he can cause a guild
or group of laborers to go on strike unless the villain is granted more power. Note that the villain can reverse
the appearance of this plot, too, by creating a situation where the strike looks inevitable unless the villain steps in
to solve it.

98

Undermine Leader’s Credibility. Villain is trying to undermine the leader’s credibility by spreading
rumors and lies indicating that the leader is not the legitimate ruler, or that he is incompetent. Presumably, the
villain has a way of stepping into power if the leader is removed.

Method (d100)
Use Fall Guys. The villain is insinuating himself into the leader’s confidence by setting up dupes to oppose
the leader – then giving information about their activities to him. The fall guys are either set up anonymously,
or they were hired directly by the villain – in which case they have to die in order for the villain’s plan to remain
under cover. A survivor would pose a serious problem for the villain if the survivor knows of the villain’s
involvement. Player characters might get hired as the dupes…
Weaken Rival – Destroy Base. The villain is trying to destroy a community that forms the base of his rival’s
economic or political power. For example, if the rival is a feudal baron, the villain might be targeting the rivals
fief or fiefdoms.

Apogee and Perigee
(solar, lunar, or other)

Perigee is the closest point in the orbit of two celestial objects, and Apogee is the
farthest point. Obviously, the orbit has to be elliptical, not circular, in order to have
closer and farther points in the orbit. Keep in mind that this near-far relationship
could exist between all kinds of celestial objects, not just suns and moons. Comet cycles
are based on apogees and perigees, meteors move around with apogees and perigees,
and even magical structures could have such a relationship to each other. Magical
objects on the earth might activate only when a sun or moon is close; or perhaps the
magical objects are huge metal blocks placed in the sky by some forgotten, ancient
species, designed for some inscrutable purpose…

Calendar Cycles

Many cultures group years into a repeating cycle, treating different years much as
Western culture interpreted the zodiacal segments of a single year. The Chinese
Calendar, for example, follows a cycle of the Year of the Rat, Year of the Ox, Year
of the Tiger, Year of the Rabbit, Year of the Dragon, Year of the Snake, Year of the
Horse, Year of the Goat, Year of the Monkey, Year of the Rooster, Year of the Dog,
and Year of the Boar. Certain characteristics are attributed to people born in the
different years.

Celestial Cycles

The zodiac is a division of the sky into twelve regions, each called a “house.” The
regions are: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius,
Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Each house is associated with behaviors and with a
particular metaphorical emblem. A fantasy world might have different zodiacal signs,
or a different method of interpreting the movements of the stars. The zodiac is linked
to the solar year, not the lunar year.

Comet Cycles

The appearance of certain predictable comets in the night sky is often given mystical
significance. Comet-cycles can be a great adventure-generating device because of
the long intervals between the comet’s appearances. Lots of unpredictable things
can happen to places, societies, and collective memory while the comet is away. For
example: if some form of lycanthropy is linked to the appearance of a comet rather
than a full moon, the lycanthropic disease might be transmitted far and wide while
dormant, then suddenly appear all over the place when the comet appears in the sky. It
would become a sort of celestial retro-virus.

Device-Driven Cycle

Equinox and Solstice
(solar cycle)

Fashion Cycles

Freezing/Thawing
Cycle

Lunar Cycle

A cycle might be derived from the operation of a device that divides time into a regular
or irregular pattern. For instance, if the cycle is determined by the burning of candles
without regard to the length of the candle, the cycle would be irregular. If the candles
were scrupulously measured to be identical, the candle-driven cycle would be regular.
Devices to measure out time could involve dripping water, candles, hourglasses, water
wheels, gears, and many other mechanical arrangements.
A solstice is one of the two times of year when the sun is farthest off the celestial
equator. These occur at approximately June 22 (the summer solstice) and December
22 (the winter solstice). Summer solstice is the shortest night of the year, and winter
solstice is the longest night. The equinox is when the sun crosses the equator and days
and nights are of closest to equal length. The equinoxes occur at approximately March
21 (the Vernal Equinox, also the first day of Spring) and September 23 (the Autumnal
Equinox). Note that Autumn and Spring are reversed for the northern and southern
hemispheres of the earth.
The types of clothes and the jewelry people wear comes into and out of fashion
periodically, as do haircuts, luxury commodities, philosophies, and religious practices.
Magical effects like planar gates could easily be influenced by fashions in behavior or
religion. It might be, for example, that a planar gate opens only when a local god has
a minimum number of worshippers present at a significant ritual. When it becomes
more fashionable for people to worship that god, the chance of the gate opening would
suddenly increase.
A particular cycle for a villain’s activities, or the opening of some sort of portal or
dungeon entrance, could be linked to the seasonal freezing and thawing of a barrier
that blocks the portal, or of a mechanism that controls it. The builder might have
intended the cycle of freezing and thawing, or the seasons might have changed since
the original construction. Freezing and thawing also affect the volume of water moving
in rivers, and patterns of migration by animals. This is a time cycle that can be used to
drive a wide variety of adventures and monsters.
Earth’s lunar cycle from new moon to new moon is 29.5 days, and is called the Synodic
Lunar Cycle. Measuring the lunar cycle based on when the moon arrives in the same
place in the sky (regardless of phase) is called the Sidereal Cycle and is 27.1 days in
length. For gaming purposes, the “average” lunar cycle of 28 days is probably close
enough unless the adventure is deeply involved in astrology. The phases of the moon
are: new moon, crescent moon, first quarter moon, waxing gibbous moon, full moon,
waning gibbous moon, last quarter moon, crescent moon, and then new moon again.
The cycle of lunar eclipses is also an excellent fantasy theme, although the cycle of an
eclipse is much longer than the cycle of the lunar phases.

Morphological
Life Cycle
(one creature)

Some creatures have a life cycle in which their form changes radically; butterflies begin
as caterpillars, frogs begin as tadpoles, many insects go through a pupae or larval
stage. Although this is related to the reproductive cycle of the species, the radical
morphological changes allow these creatures to have the right body-form for the right
purpose at the right time. The caterpillar form, for example, is well adapted to eating
huge quantities of food, whereas the mobility of the butterfly stage allows for finding
stronger mates more easily. Intelligent creatures with morphological cycles might open
and close portals (or be able to, based on their current phase). For example, a gate
might remain closed while eggs gestate in some bizarre inter-dimensional space, or be
opened when the creatures are in a predatory body-form and then close again. Only
the strong and well fed predators would make it back to the gate, and would then be
all together within the gate for the mating cycle to begin. The possible variations on
this pattern are quite numerous. If a villain is acting according to such a life cycle, it’s
not necessarily because the villain is one of the morphologically shifting creatures. It
might be that the villain knows how to take advantage of the changing life forms of the
creatures, or that he’s allied to them but can only take advantage of the alliance when
the creatures are in an intelligent form, a dangerous form, a magically powerful form,
or what have you. Again, the possibilities are vast.

Morphological
Life Cycle
(series of creatures)

Just as a particular life form may go through radical morphological changes in order
to link up form with function in a series of steps, it is also possible for a species to
generate a sequence of life forms, only one of which is the breeder. As an example,
envision a life form whose “queen” and “drone” eggs stay dormant for a long period
of time, and need to be shifted from a hot incubation environment to a colder hatching
environment. One “generation” of workers is a hot-weather creature that cares for
the eggs during the incubation phase. As the incubation phase ends, the worker mate
among themselves, producing an entirely different form – a flying form well suited
for migration. The flying forms transport the eggs to a colder climate in a migration,
breed again to create a cold-weather worker caste, and then die. The cold-weather
caste hatches rapidly in the cold, and these workers care for the queen and drone eggs.
The queens and drones fly back to the hot-weather area to breed and lay eggs of three
kinds: queens, drones, and more hot-weather workers. The hot-weather workers hatch
quickly to care for the new queen and drone eggs, and the cycle begins again. At some
point in such a cycle, it might be that the door to underground hatching chambers must
be unsealed, or the migration might take place across different planes of existence,
requiring the temporary opening of planar gates. A villain’s motivation in all this could
be of many different kinds: he might be intercepting the migrations, stealing eggs, using
the unique capabilities of one of the life forms in an alliance, etc.

Planetary Cycles

The proximity of particular planets to the Earth, or their location within a region
of the sky (particularly a zodiacal region) can be a usable cycle for the purposes of a
fantasy world, possibly having effects on magic, on different kinds of magic, villain
motivations, and the opening or closing of planar gates or dungeon entrances.

Reproductive Cycle

The average human menstrual cycle is 28 days. If the villainess is non-human, the
cycle might not be a menstrual cycle, but a cycle of being “in heat” or “in season.”
This same pattern might apply to unusual monsters as well as non-human animals.
Female dogs stay in heat for about 21-28 days depending on breed (as one example of
a heat cycle). Note: the cycle of a male villain’s activity might be linked to someone
else’s reproductive cycle. The purpose of a dungeon or planar gate that opens and
seals based on the reproductive cycle of a tribe or being is fairly obvious, and could
(ahem) give birth to interesting adventure scenarios.

Rising and Falling
Magical Power

The lunar, menstrual, and solar cycles are all associated with the rise and fall of
magical capabilities, but a fantasy world may have an independent cycle of rising a
falling magical power, not marked by these factors. Fluctuations in magic power might
be druidic (some fluctuation in the earth’s spiritual nature), might be related to arcane
magic (a fluctuation in the eldritch energy that can be tapped by spells) or might be
related to a fluctuation in divine power (possibly related to planar “distance, a period
of dormancy, or divine battles that occupy the attention of the gods from time to time).
A wizard’s personal capability might be linked to the concept of “mana,” personal
reserves of magical power that might shift with the tides of time. Monsters might also
feel the effects of magical change.

Scriptural Cycle

Secondary Effect
Cycle

Temperature Cycles

Traumatic Stress
Cycle

In Judaism, the Torah (that’s the five books of Moses, in case you’re not familiar) is
divided into parshas (segments) one of which is read and studied each seven days. The
parshas correspond to the Jewish lunar calendar, so that the same parsha is read at the
same lunar date every year. The point of completion of the reading, when the Torah
scroll is rolled back to the beginning is a major holiday, as is the middle of the Torah
(the day of atonement) and the reading on the new year (which precedes the day of
atonement by a week). A religious scripture in a fantasy world might also follow a cycle
not related to the calendar – planar gates or subterranean chambers might be opened
(or open of their own accord) in a cycle driven by the reading of scriptures instead
of a calendar cycle. The reading itself might trigger these events, rather than merely
corresponding to them.
Any of the various cycles listed in this table might be the cause of some other
secondary effect that normally (but does not always) result from the primary cycle. For
instance, the hatching patterns of locusts often (but does not always) cause famines.
The focus of your adventure might not be the locust hatching, but the resulting famine.
The periodic flooding of the Nile river was necessary to good harvests in Ancient
Egypt; when that cycle failed due to low rainfall in the African interior, famines and
food shortages resulted in Egypt. Adventures premised upon the secondary effects
of a primary cycle might focus on the times when the expected result (the flooding of
the Nile, or a locust plague) doesn’t take place. Why didn’t it? The answer might be
valuable, crucial, or financially rewarding.
Variations in temperature can cause all sorts of varying human behaviors, cause
changes in economic factors, and can also trigger certain events in the animal and plant
kingdoms. Consider such things as a locust-like insect with eggs that lie dormant until
particularly hot temperatures arrive. In a completely different sort of example, consider
than a villain’s opportunities for villainy might be considerably enhanced if the local
community is snowbound, huddled up in cottages instead of wandering about the
village with prying eyes that might see what he’s doing…
Individuals who have suffered traumatic stress may re-live the event or its emotional
impact, and this often happens on or around the anniversary of the event. The cycle
could also be based on any cycle of events that either symbolize or reproduce the
conditions and setting of the traumatic event. A fantasy world might have an analogue,
in other words, to the way many combat veterans react to the sound of helicopters
and/or fireworks.

UNUSUAL MINIONS AND LIEUTENANTS
Many of the above tables involve a villain’s minions. An adventure is usually improved by having some of these minions
be unusual in some respect. In particular, if the villain has an interesting minion, the nature of the minion can generate some
interesting ideas about the villain’s plot. This might seem backward, but creating an adventure isn’t always a linear process. Ideas
about “later” parts, or little details, can sometimes generate fantastic ideas for the adventure’s overall structure.

referees who prefer to build outward from evocative details, fitting the backbone into the details rather than vice versa. Never be
afraid to go back and change even the fundamental premises of an adventure if your later ideas cause it to evolve in a new direction. Writing an adventure is not a linear process, and creativity is not an orderly process. It’s more like a jigsaw puzzle – there’s
no predicting which parts of the puzzle will start coming together until you start.

INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER TWO
This second chapter focuses on monsters – mainly on creating new ones for use in an adventure. Monsters aren’t quite the “top level” of
adventure design, like locations and missions, but sometimes they are the primary and driving force behind the creation of an adventure,
giving rise to the location or the mission instead of vice versa. I can think of many of my own adventures that were sparked by monsters,
and when I’m beginning the adventure creation process I often look for ideas by paging through monster books. Like the first book in this
series, the objective is not to provide on-the-fly tables for quick use. There are other monster-generation books which already do this quite
well. Instead, this book is designed to tap a deeper creative wellspring – which can be hard when you’re under time pressure with players
tossing potato chips at you and asking if you’re ready to start. The book can be used for on-the-fly ideas, but to use it at full power, so to
speak, it works best ahead of time. It’s a doubly powerful tool when used in conjunction with the first book of the series, but it absolutely
isn’t necessary to have the first book in order to use this one.

MONSTERS GENERALLY
One of the best ways to come up with the idea for an adventure is to start with a monster,
or combination of monsters, and work from there. And if you’re lucky enough to get the
sudden inspiration for a brand new monster, often the adventure will write itself from there
almost without further effort.
Good monsters are more than just an agglomeration of statistics and abilities thrown together. In many cases, what you need to create a monster (especially if it is supposed to inspire
an adventure) is some other detail besides or in addition to the monster’s combat profile. In
many cases, those additional details can define a combat profile much better than the bruteforce method of generating trial-and-error combinations over and over again.
This chapter is divided into two main parts: generating monsters by specific type (undead,
etc.), and a set of general tables. The general tables can also be used as a starting point, beginning with the monster’s Combat Profile, but this method calls for slightly larger creative leaps
than starting with the type. Most of the details generated from the monster type tables will
refer the designer to one or more of the general tables in the second section.

BEASTS
A beast is a monster that lives in the fantasy world’s natural ecosystem. It
probably isn’t more intelligent than a regular animal, although it might be
unusually cunning. Giant ants and griffons are both examples of this sort
of monster. If your adventure requires an interesting roving predator, or an
infestation of bizarre creatures, this is probably the category you’ll want to use
as a starting point to generate some ideas.
Step 1: Get a Starter Image of the Body Form. Roll on the Creature Attributes table for a basic body form. You’re not locked into this body form, but I have
always found it easiest to come up with interesting details when I’ve got a vague
picture of the monster already in mind. Sometimes the details are interesting
enough to warrant changing the whole concept retroactively to fit them. If
that happens, I consider it a perfect result.
Step 2: Mix Attributes of Two Creatures. Roll twice on the Creature Attributes Table (2-2). Take an attribute from the
first creature (any attribute, your choice) and mix it with an attribute from the second creatures (again, your choice). Let’s say

that you started with a Cheetah’s body form, and then rolled 12 (Beetle) and 16 (Canary). One possibility is to say that you’ve

got a giant beetle that chases down its prey like a cheetah and kills it with a sharp beak (canary). A third possibility is to discard

A summons

got a cat-like predator with a beetle’s exoskeleton that has bright, canary-like coloration. Another possibility is to say that you’ve
the cheetah (that was just a starting point) and create a beetle that sings sweetly to draw its prey close for the kill (presumably
with a saving throw to avoid the effects of the song).
Step 3: Fill in the Details. Roll for Special Attacks, Special Defenses, and Defining Attributes on Table 2-64. Tie those
results into the Creature Attributes you’ve already generated, or treat the results as new features to add into the monster’s description.

FOLKLORIC SHAPE-ADAPTATIONS
The folkloric shape-adaptation is a quick list of ways in which myths and legends have changed the shape of normal animals
into mythological and folkloric monsters. I think it’s very restrictive if used as a random generation table, but sometimes it can
be helpful as a quick-reference tool.

CONSTRUCTS
Constructs are man-made objects that have at least rudimentary
intelligence, and probably can also move. As such, they share enough
characteristics that it makes sense to lump them together for creative
ideas, but as monsters these types can be quite different – some

magically-implanted intelligence, some might only follow orders, and some of them might have some sort of
machine-intelligence. Obviously, these different origins
will tend to fit into radically different types of adventure
settings and in the service of radically different villains
(if, indeed, they are still in anyone’s service at all once the
adventurers encounter them). It’s worth mentioning that the
folkloric theme of a created monster getting out of control is a
very, very common one.

Type of Construct

Comments

Elemental-animated or spiritanimated machine or object

An elemental creature or a creature from the spirit-world has been
bound into the object, machine, or structure as the force that animates
it. The imprisoned/bound creature provides the object with whatever
intelligence or cunning it possesses.

Heretical machine

Magically animated object in its
natural shape

Animated chairs, tables, catapults, etc.

Shadow vessel
Restless inquiry

Magically Augmented Machine

A machine that doesn’t operate purely by means of technology, and may
not include any mechanical components at all other than hinges and
bolts. A basic example is an iron cobra with no inner mechanisms – it
is an object specifically designed to be animated. On the more complex
side of the spectrum might be a huge lobster-shaped battle robot
powered by magical pistons and gears, but with no magic animating the
mechanisms driven by those pistons and gears.

Spirit-animated substance, in a
prepared shape

This includes the classic man-shaped golem, but could be any shape. A
spirit could be imprisoned in a garbage pile, and then you’d have an
animated garbage-pile.

True Machine

This is either a machine with some sort of artificial brain, or a machine
with no intelligence whatsoever.

PHYSICAL DANGER POSED BY CONSTRUCT
It’s easiest to start creating a construct by focusing on what sort of risk it poses to the adventurers. This list of physical dangers constructs can cause is more focused than the larger tables of physical attacks (Table 2-64), and may be a better starting
point. After getting a general picture of the construct’s physical threat, and if the construct is more than just a physical monster,
roll on the large table of special attacks (Table 2-71).

don’t use this table much for generating a construct directly, but it has worked very well if I think of this as the room where a

REASON FOR CREATING CONSTRUCT
The creator’s purpose for building the construct can give you ideas for what the construct does. This table is my favorite way
to get ideas for the more unusual constructs, especially where the primary threat might not be physical damage.

CONSTRUCT’S LOSS OF CONTROL
One feature of constructs in folklore is the potential for them to go out of the creator’s control. Consider Walt Disney’s The
Sorcerer’s Apprentice and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein as examples. Many versions of the original golem folktale (in which the golem
is created by a Cabbalist rabbi to protect the Jews of Prague from a pogrom) also include the golem’s attempt to remain “alive”
once its purpose is served. In general, this theme is more applicable to constructs that are animated by an imprisoned or summoned spirit rather than those which are purely mechanisms or magically-augmented medieval technology. Not every construct
should be subject to loss of control, or the theme becomes a bit overused.

and other dragon-like beasts. The difficulty with generating
unusual body forms for dragons is that if you get too far away
from the basic lizard-like reptile with bat wings, you start to get
something that isn’t really a dragon any more. Therefore, these
tables focus on three components of a dragon or draconic
monster: a single unusual physical feature, a single unusual
ability (with a sub-table for breath weapons), and the dragon’s
mentality.

21-24

Sings beautifully (and probably dangerously). This might be in a human-type voice, or it might be trilling or
whistling.

25-28

Theme: Perceptive. The dragon has unusual powers of perception that give it an advantage in combat. In
general, it will either be able to predict how it’s going to be attacked (defensive) or find weaknesses in the
opponents (leading to some sort of attack bonus). The nature of the perception might give the dragon other
benefits for things like avoiding being taken by surprise. The actual mechanism could include ESP, smell, high
intelligence, or precognition.

Held for ransom

29-32

Theme: Illusion. The dragon can change the perceptions of its opponents. The source might be to magically
produce visual illusions, or to use some sort of magical mind domination.

Tines, tongs, forks

Theme: Hidden. The dragon can conceal itself, camouflage itself, or hide in unexpected places for an ambush
(under water, in shadows, in walls, on ceilings, etc)

destroyed

37-40

Theme: Don’t hurt it (acidic blood, corrosive surface, or other downside to using physical attacks). This is similar
to the “don’t touch it” theme, but the effect only kicks in if the dragon is physically damaged. This could also
include reflecting spells, transferring damage to another, or being healed by certain types of attacks.

41-44

Theme: Spellcaster. The dragon casts spells, casts spells more powerfully than expected, or casts a wider variety
of spells than one might expect. Alternatively, the dragon might simply have an array of natural abilities that
mimic spells.

UNUSUAL BREATH WEAPON

A thing that turns

Unusual breath weapons don’t figure prominently in the unusual abilities table above, which is designed to focus on sparking
the designer’s higher creativity. However, for a dragon that’s simply a slight deviation from the norm, a variant breath weapon is
often all that’s needed – breath weapons, after all, are probably the most defining feature of dragons. If you want your dragon to
breathe fire, poison gas, electricity (lightning), acid, or frost, but in a different way than normal, don’t roll on the first column –
just roll on the second.

Mentality, Motivation, or Status

01-05

Arcane. Whether or not the dragon is a good spell caster, it knows a great deal of useful arcane lore it has
accumulated over the years. It might even have human magic-user followers, who seek to gain the bits of
knowledge it occasionally provides to them.

06-10

Assembling Followers. Followers, for this purpose, include a set of young or baby dragons, or a group of
fanatical worshippers, or an army of mercenaries, or even something stranger like a collection of trained slimes
or a trained pack of giant lizards.

11-15

Collector. The dragon hoards a particular type of item. Some of these might be relatively innocuous, such as
musical instruments. On the other hand, a dragon who collects human skulls is possibly a big problem.

16-20

Connoisseur. The dragon constantly seeks a supply of something with a particular taste or quality. This
might range from captives to fine wines.

Table 2-16: Individual Dragon’s Mentalities, Motivations, and Status continued
Die Roll

Mentality, Motivation, or Status

21-25

Constrained to Action. The dragon is forced, either through its nature or due to magic, to respond in certain
ways to certain stimuli. Examples of this include: not being able to tell a lie, required to grant a wish if defeated
in combat, required to hunt down a particular individual, required to guard a certain object, etc.

26-30

Damsel-Kidnapper. Pretty standard.

31-35

Demonic. As with many Christian dragon-stories of the middle ages, the dragon is actually the servant of a
supernatural evil power rather than just a preternatural creature. Dragons that are a form of demon might have
a demonic master nearby, or one that can be summoned. Alternatively, the dragon might be able to summon
lesser demons of some kind into its service. This sort of dragon would be considerably more sinister than a
regular dragon, but not necessarily much more intelligent.

36-40

Vassal. The dragon is subservient to, enchanted by, subdued by, or sworn to another being. For a folkloric
type of dragon, it might be in love with a human maiden or controlled by some other creature weaker than the
dragon itself. Not likely, though.

41-45

Envoy or Scout. The dragon is exploring or negotiating on behalf of some other villain elsewhere. The
questions to be resolved are: (1) on whose behalf is the dragon negotiating, and (2) with whom is the dragon
negotiating, monsters or humans?

46-50

Foreigner. The dragon comes from a different place, either because it has a nomadic personality or because it
was chased out. It is likely working on establishing a new lair.

51-55

Hide. The dragon is virtually obsessed with keeping itself hidden from human notice (or perhaps from the
notice of a stronger dragon, or other enemy or threat). This might be due to caution, might be a younger
dragon’s strategy for getting older and bigger, or might just be due to cowardice.

56-60

Imprisoned. The dragon is in some way confined to an area, either because the exit isn’t large enough, or
because it is scared to leave, or because it is under a mental or magical compulsion, etc.

61-65

Infamy (reputation). The dragon seeks to be well known as a threat, but unlike the knight-killer it approaches
the project in an intelligent and possibly even devious manner.

66-70

Intense Greed. This dragon is even greedier than most, being easily bribed and unable to resist theft.

71-75

Kill Knights (reputation). The dragon seeks to be well known as a threat. Note that for survival reasons, this is
already a fairly dim bulb of a dragon, since the famous ones don’t live long. Being relatively stupid, this dragon
is focused upon killing powerful humans, and it defines “powerful” basically as those who wear heavy armor.
This is the best explanation I can invent for the classic stereotype.

76-80

Land-Destroyer. At whatever speed possible, the dragon seeks to turn the area around its lair into a
wasteland. It spends time fouling water, destroying trees and crops, and killing wildlife.

81-85

Political Power. The dragon seeks to have human minions and influence over civilized areas, rather than
eating (too many) humans or destroying crops. This dragon might even protect its serfs in time of danger.

86-90

Secrets and Wisdom. The dragon knows a great deal of useful information; maps of a dungeon area, legends
about magic items, and other such useful tidbits can be gained from talking to this dragon rather than killing it.
Of course, conversation might not be possible unless the dragon is suitably terrified.

91-95

Vendetta. Some event in the dragon’s past has caused it to swear vengeance against a group, species, or
religion. This could be virtually anything ranging from a wide category like “magic-users,” to a single individual,
to a specific village, to members of a particular order of knights.

96-00

Wounded or Crippled. The dragon might be blind or missing a limb from a past accident or battle. If the
dragon didn’t win that combat, it is likely consumed with a desire for vengeance.

ELEMENTALS
Elementals are creatures associated with a fundamental “element” of nature. These elements, as theorized by European
alchemists, were fire, water, earth, and air. The first explicit use of the elemental creature concept is in Michael Moorcock’s Elric
stories, in which Elric summons the lord of the Earth elementals and the lord of the Water elementals. The idea that elemental
creatures are hierarchical comes from these stories, and fantasy gaming further developed the idea of elemental social strata
by drafting djinn and efreet into the role of nobles. Not only are genies closely associated with fire and air, but Arabian folklore
also ascribed to them the same kind of bargaining and binding that characterized Moorcock’s elementals in the Elric stories.
These tables reflect the concept that there is an entire sub-world of creatures associated
with each element of nature, living in some “other” place but capable of being
summoned into normal reality – or perhaps sneaking in from time to time.
The creatures of these sub-worlds (presumably treated as a separate plane

of existence) are organized into social strata, and can be bound to service
in various ways.

ELEMENTAL PLANE OF ORIGIN
Inventing an elemental creature can go along one of two creative avenues: either it’s a new and innovative use of one of the
four basic elements (fire, water, earth, and air), or it’s based on an unusual element. The primary elements are the first four
entries, so if you want a “traditional” elemental you can roll a d4 and move forward. Note also that if you want to generate

METHOD OF BINDING THE ELEMENTAL CREATURE
One of the key features of elementals of all kinds, from genies to summoned elementals, is that they can be bound to the

service of powerful masters. In many cases, particularly in the case of the more intelligent elementals such as genies, there is a
specific means by which the elemental can be controlled (and serious risks if you get it wrong).

CONDITIONS IN ELEMENTAL REGION
Although it’s really more of an adventure-generating idea than a monster-creating idea, you can get some good ideas about
elementals by thinking about what conditions are like in the elemental region whence the creature comes. This doesn’t mean the
conditions of the entire elemental plane – merely the part of that plane whence the creature comes.

FEY CREATURES

Lawyer

The concept of a fey creature is a gamer-created mishmash of virtually all folkloric creatures that don’t eat humans, aren’t
of godlike power, aren’t significantly larger than humans, are corporeal, and are basically of a human body type. The gamer
model of fey creatures relies most heavily on the sidhe (Ireland) and the wee folk (Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Bretagne) mixed in
with corporeal nature-spirits from numerous other cultures (the nymphs and dryads of Ancient Greek mythology being a prime
example). These tables essentially retro-engineer the artificial category of “Fey” by returning to the folkloric sources of the

Unexpected

Snakes
Draped with cloth

creatures commonly labeled as being in the category, drawing out resemblances and common features. That being said, there is
a general set of folkloric characteristics attributed to the traditional creatures of the “fey” category:
1. They are associated with nature and the wilderness, and often tied to a specific place in the wilderness such as a
tree or river;
2. They are difficult to find when sought – often because they inhabit a sort of magically hidden “otherworld,” can

vanish away if not physically held, or can become invisible;
3. Most are extremely cunning, but vulnerable to trickery due to their extreme pride or greed (generally for food or
gold);
4. They show virtually no compassion for human beings, with the exception of Victorian England’s tiny fairies with
their butterfly wings and flower-dwellings;
5. They are corporeal;
6. They are frequently (but not always) associated with magical items;
7. They are frequently associated with transformations of themselves or those who anger them;
8. They are, almost universally, absolutely forced to honor bargains to which they have agreed, even if the bargain

was made under duress.
A major exception to the general rule: talking animals seem to have been adopted into this category, but these are generally
helpful to humans in most folklore, rather than compassionless. Helpful talking animals appear frequently in the troubadour
tales of the proto-renaissance of the Twelfth Century and in the Germanic folklore recorded by the Brothers Grimm. A second

exception: the Irish sidhe (pronounced “shee”) and some Arthurian fey-types are associated with unnatural passage of time
in their realms and with taking slaves or captives. This isn’t a universal constant among folkloric creatures, but it is a common
theme nonetheless.

Broken brickwork
Spiders

Final note about the tables: since the concept of fey is a bastardized catch-all type of category, the monster-designer should
feel free to break as many of these general rules as may be necessary to create a good monster.

FEY CONTRACTS
It is a constantly recurring theme in folklore that the wee folk and other nature spirits can be forced to serve or to give up treasure if the right bargain is struck or the right commands invoked. In this way, the fey folk are much like genies and elementals
(and the following table is accordingly similar to Table 2-16).

SUMMONING FEY CREATURES
Many fey creatures are subject to being summoned or called from their homes to assist the summoner. In general, some kind
of bargain needs to be struck, but the bargain could potentially already exist, or have been negotiated ahead of time. Since lots
of these methods involve some kind of speech, the required speech might include the offered terms of the bargain, which might
influence the success of the summoning/calling.

Method of Summoning

Ancient Promise. Recital of an ancient promise of assistance is another way to summon a fey creature, but
these are generally difficult to discover, and the fey creature is likely to do whatever it can (later on) to make sure
the recital isn’t passed on or used a second time.

Pure nonsense

01-10

11-20

Body Part. If the summoner has a lock of the fey creature’s hair (or some other body part), a particular spoken
charm or magic word could be sufficient to call the creature

What was
delivered

21-30

Creature’s Name. Knowing the creature’s name might be enough to summon it, particularly if there is a little
rhyme, magic word, dance, or pattern of steps to go along with speaking the name. (For some reason, movement
of feet seems to be much more associated with the fey than movement of arms or hands).

31-40

Creature’s Possession. Some fey creatures are linked to a particular possession (pipes, hat, etc) and can be
called in virtually any way if the summoner has possession of this item.

41-50

Insults and Place. Near the creature’s home, or in some other specified place like a circle of toadstools, a
series of biting insults might call the creature forth … but not necessarily in a good mood.

51-60

Musical Tune. Certain tunes, if played absolutely perfectly and without error, might summon the fey creature.
In order to keep this method from being used over and over again, it might be a tune that backfires dangerously
if not played correctly.

Place and Activity. The right combination of a place (ring of mushrooms, stone circle, near the creature’s
home, etc) and an activity (lighting a fire with pine cones, dancing, singing, cooking bacon, etc) might be an
irresistible temptation for this sort of fey creature’s greed or curiosity.

81-90

Place, Time, and Speech. It might be possible to summon the fey creature when there is a particular
combination of the time (autumn, midsummer, midnight, lunar phase, etc), the right words, and the right place
(often a crossroads or a forest glade).

91-00

Smells. Cooking a certain combination of (strange) ingredients might summon the fey creature just from a
smell the creature finds irresistible.

GIANTS
There are Norse giants, Celtic giants, Japanese giants (if
that’s how you class the Oni), Ancient Greek giants, etcetera
and etcetera. What’s useful to the adventure-creator is
that these giants are not at all the same in terms of
what they look like, how they behave, and what their
powers are – with one exception being that they are
almost universally pretty stupid. Ancient Greek giants (as opposed to the semi-divine titans) were almost
always deformed in some way; hundred-handed giants

and the one-eyed Cyclops are examples. Norse giants are
powerful enough to stand toe-to-toe with the gods themselves,
and are members of distinct sub-types (fire and frost). Arthurian/Provencal giants do not seem to be members of sub-types,
but they all have brothers (usually in groups of three). The Japanese Oni have taken on a giant or ogre-like standard appearance,
but they are also highly associated with the spirit world and older
folklore doesn’t always portray the Oni in this way (people can
be possessed by oni, for example). Celtic giants tend to be
more intelligent than the giants of other cultures, even tricky

in some cases.
It is an unfortunate result of the early adventure modules
Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl,
and Hall of the Fire Giant Chief that giants are often portrayed
in role-playing games as tribal creatures. This isn’t the case
in folklore, where giants tend to be quite solitary and have
unique powers. There is a lot of room in creative adventure design to take the folkloric model of the solitary
giant with unique powers and/or possessions and use it to

craft an excellent adventure. Avoid, though, the fairy-tale
sequence of the giant and his brothers; it’s too repetitious
– I’ve tried it.

HUMANOIDS
This section isn’t just about goblinoids, it’s about any species of bipedal creatures
without powerful magical abilities except in unusual members of the species. For
instance, since the “Fey” category tends to exclude monsters that have non-mammalian
characteristics, monsters that are not particularly hard to find, and monsters that eat

One, two, four.
Bales of hay
Indications

humans, creatures with these attributes might fall into the category of “humanAltered items

oids.”
Humanoid species are characterized by their physical structure, interactions with
other sub-types, animal alliances, social organization, and any unusual or characteristic cultural behaviors. Put a bookmark at Table 2-2 while using these tables, because
they refer back to it several times.

might be sterile, or might be capable of
interbreeding with the normal members
of the species.

Most relations are trade-oriented, but the species may have strange
approaches to trade (violence, rituals, or honor might factor in, for
example). Trading with the creatures might be a dangerous venture.

Generally assist other races and act in coordination with them,
provided that the other species is working toward goals that agree
with those of the species (or of the leader-types). This would be a
species that works from long-range plans, possibly (but definitely not
necessarily) a mastermind species.

species of wolf-like creatures that live with wolves, etc. In general, the animal alliance will be with the same creature whose

attributes are shared with the humanoid species.
**Interesting Weapon. The species manufactures and/or uses some weapon that other species can’t use well. A species of fourarmed warriors might use a very heavy flail using all four hands, as a very simple example. The key here, though, is that the
weapon should have some effect that makes tactical combat interesting. The weapon might have a chance to disarm, poison,
cause disease, immobilize, hamper, or weaken opponents, or might just deal greater-than-normal damage in the hands of one
of the members of the humanoid species.

*** Minor special attacks will also, generally, be related to the underlying animal type that has been mixed with human attributes
to create the humanoid species. Crab-men might have pincers, for example, or the ability to drag opponents under the water.
**** Unusual Abilities will be related to the underlying animal type. Crab-men would be able to breathe under water.
***** Even though Mastermind Species is listed as a relationship to other species, that doesn’t necessarily give the broadest picture – rolling a second time on Column 2 might get you an interesting picture of how a mastermind species functions.

THEMATIC IDEAS FOR MASTERMIND HUMANOID SPECIES
If the entire species is considerably more intelligent than humankind, the concept probably requires more detail. A species of
masterminds will travel in smaller groups instead of tribes, individuals may have minions from another species, and the species
may make a recurring appearance in more than one adventure. The table below offers various thematic groupings of ideas

Rakshasa
A distant thunder

that can work together for the “signature” element of a mastermind humanoid species. The items in each theme are sometimes
contradictory, and the themes are vague and open-ended. They are intended to spark thought processes, not to provide a closed
and complete list.

In the case of mastermind species, adding some sort of background in addition to the themes of Table 2-38 may help to
define how the members of the species think. Use the table below to generate a sequential history of the species. There is a 50%
chance that the species became masterminds during the first stage, and (if they didn’t) a 50% chance in the second stage and a
100% chance in the third stage. Once this thought-exercise is finished, and has given you ideas about the mastermind species,
feel free to discard the details of the history – a history isn’t needed at all to have a good monster species.

61-70

Evolved in water

Arrived at present location (world,
moon, subterranean realms, etc) via
a migration to avoid a natural or
magical catastrophe in their original
location

Became expert breeders of a monster
type (or new hybrid) that accompanies
most members of the species. If the
physical characteristics of the species were
determined using Table 2-2, the animal
is probably the underlying animal used to
generate the species’ physical characteristics.

71-80

Created or bred by a
more powerful species
(now extinct) to fulfill
a specific function
in the society of that
species – food, laborers,
accountants, spellcasters, etc.

Developed a caste structure with
different abilities for the different
castes (this can include entering into
corporeal bodies of different types)

Reproductive competition separates the
males or females from each other. One
gender is polygamous or polyandrous, and
the other gender is probably smaller, weaker,
and/or less intelligent.

81-90

Began as a species
of incorporeal spiritbeings, gaining bodies
as a result of the events
in the second stage (next
column)

Rebellion within the society
caused a split within the species (a
multiple caste structure, division
into powerful leaders and lesser
followers, or two hostile sub- species)

Entire species is now subject to a Time
Cycle (Table 1-29), although not all
members of the species are necessarily
subject to the same influences at the same
times – they may be out of synch with
each other. This would be due to events in
columns 1 or 2, but it has become more or
less pronounced than earlier.

91-00

Evolved as flying
creatures, but unless
you want them to retain
flight, they lose their
flying capabilities during
the Second Stage (next
column)

Extinction of a more powerful
species allowed this species to grab
power and magic, which led to
higher intelligence

Each member of the species accumulates
knowledge or unusual items that make each
individual member of the species relatively
unique in its capabilities.

MIST CREATURES
Mist creatures are normally unintelligent, acting on instinct. They can normally be damaged in only a few ways, and often
function in the nature of a localized hazard. The table below offers two other suggestions: mist-monsters created by a machine,
and mist-monsters created by another monster-type. In addition to being a naturally-occurring phenomenon, they might also be
created by divine (or demonic) vengeance, by the prayers or invocations of a large number of people, by a dimensional rift, or by

PLANAR CREATURES
Planar creatures are monsters having their origin or home in
another dimension, reality, or plane of existence. There are five basic
divisions of planar creatures (angels aren’t really covered, since we’re

DARK ANGEL (PLANAR CREATURE TYPE)
Dark angels are the tempters and plotters of demonic and fiendish realms. They have a basically human appearance, but
with one or more demonic hints. If the Dark Angel is engaged in infiltrating human society or tempting people into evil deeds, it
will likely do its best to conceal or downplay the demonic hint.

DEMONIC CREATURES (PLANAR CREATURE TYPE)
Demonic creatures are not in the business of tempting or persuading anyone; they are destructive and feral, although they
might be extremely intelligent in their tactics and methods (they might, for example, assemble an army of minions). These sorts
of demons can be more easily controlled when they are summoned to a chaotic or evil caster’s service, but if the caster loses

SUMMONED CREATURES (PLANAR CREATURE TYPE)
Summoned creatures are those that aren’t demonic in nature, but come from some other dimension, alternate reality, other reality, or from a non-demonic plane of existence. They don’t ordinarily cross over into the material plane, and are usually called
forth for some specific purpose. From my experiences with using the following tables, it works best to get an idea about what it’s
summoned to do (Table 2-49) before generating information about the creature’s body type– this helps to adjust the monster’s
physical appearance when you roll on Table 2-50.

As one example of how to use these tables, let’s generate a summoned creature.
First, we roll a result of 41 on Table 2-50, and discover that the normal reason for summoning our
creature is to use it as a food harvester. Next, we roll a result of 78 on Table 2-51, learning that the
creature has the head of a beast, a human body, and a tail. We roll a 60 on Table 2-2, which suggests
that our creature has the head of an octopus. One immediate idea coming from these random results is that the creature is used to harvest food underwater, since it has the head of an octopus.
We roll on Table 2-52 to see what it’s made of, and (rolling a 98 on the first column of that table) we
discover that our creature is made of green-flecked stone. And finally, rolling a 29 on Table 2-53, we
find that if the summons is done incorrectly, the summoned creature will be weaker than normal, or
deformed. From somewhere, probably because the thing sounds so much like Cthulhu, I decide that
it is normally summoned by tribesmen (and that’s either to catch some sort of big fish, or dive for
pearls). It sounds silly to have a stone statue swimming underwater, so browsing through the tables
I decide that it’s a fungus, instead of being made of stone.
So now we have a creature that rises from a growth of fungus when summoned, shaping the fungi
into a massive man-shaped thing with the head of an octopus, which harvests pearls at the dead of
night in deep waters. If the summons is not made correctly, the shape rising from the fungi will be
misshapen, and weaker than normal … or perhaps diseased. H.P. Lovecraft would adore it.

PHYSICAL FORM OF SUMMONED CREATURE
Note: This table makes frequent references to Table 2-2, a list of animals and their attributes. Sometimes it’s easier to just
come up with animal types on the fly while using this table, but if you want to get completely random results, I would bookmark
Table 2-2 before starting to roll the dice.

TRAVELERS (PLANAR CREATURE TYPE)
Travelers are trans-planar creatures that move across planes of existence on their own accord (as opposed to summoned
creatures). Perhaps the most important feature of these monsters, from the standpoint of designing an adventure, is why they
do so. What is their motivation for shifting from plane to plane, or from alternate world to alternate world? Obviously, most
of these creatures are intelligent, often far above the human norm. Predatory travelers should generally be treated as Horrors
or Demonic Creatures (see above) rather than generated under the tables below, which are designed to generate creatures with
more complex motivations than mere feeding.

VISITATIONS (PLANAR CREATURE TYPE)
Visitations are (usually) non-intelligent manifestations of energy, overlapping with elementals and undead but best treated, for
purposes of creating monsters, as a separate category. They are presumed to be acting on instinct, or might have no intelligence

Webs of sand
Curse of the Earth

whatsoever, being a manifestation or echo of something happening in another plane rather than creatures in their own right. An
intelligent visitation would be possible, but unusual. Something that created a sapient echo in the material plane would be a very
significant extra-planar event indeed.

Good plant monsters are really hard to design. They’ve not only

Specific Type of Form (d100)

Bamboo

Limbs or body-part moves, but the rest of the plant is immobile (rooted). The plant is
purely a melee fighter. (Roll on Table 2-74: Limb Attacks)

Broad leaves

Limbs or body part moves, but the rest of the plant is immobile. The plant uses a special
attack to augment damage from the limbs: roll on the Limb Attacks Table (2-74) to get
ideas for the limbs, and roll on Table 2-61 to get ideas for the nature of the augmenting
attack.

Bush or shrub

Limbs or body part moves, but the rest of the plant is immobile. The plant uses a special
“pulling” attack to draw prey to the limbs: roll on the Limb Attacks Table (2-74) to
get ideas for the limbs, and roll on Table 2-61 to get ideas for the nature of the special
pulling attack.

Cone

Limbs or a body part of the plant move (roll on Table 2-74 for ideas), but the rest of
the plant is immobile. The plant not only uses a special “pulling” attack to draw prey
towards it, but also has a special attack to augment damage from the limbs. Roll on both
columns of Table 2-61 to determine the nature of the pulling and augmenting special
attacks.

Coral-type growth

No part of the plant moves, but it delivers a poisonous or transformational substance
into its near vicinity. Delivery mechanisms include: spores, smells, spiked seed-pods
on the ground, blown leaves, and gases. The result of falling prey to these substances
include turning into a similar plant, turning into a plant-creature controlled by the plant,
turning into a seed-carrier for the plant, or just dying to create fertilizer. Keep in mind
that creatures killed for fertilizer might also be caused to rot faster than normal after
dying.

26-30

Fern

No part of the plant moves, but it has mental powers. These probably include
the telekinetic ability to damage opponents using nearby rocks or equipment, or
even picking opponents up. Other possibilities include mental powers that mimic
enchantment-type magic – the plant can dominate someone’s mind to create an ally
(who will later be used to fetch fertilizing carcasses to the plant’s roots).

31-35

Grass-like stalks

The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility types). It is purely a melee
fighter, using its movement ability solely to get into close enough range for hand-tobranch combat. Roll on the Limb Attacks Table (2-74) to get ideas for how it attacks.

fighting with mobile limbs (see Limb Attacks Table), it has a Physical Distance Attack
(Table 2-62) AND an Augmenting Attack (Table 2-62). The Physical Distance Attack
causes general damage (hit points or equivalent).

81-85

Tree, short

The plant is rooted to the ground, but super-charged with weaponry. It has a melee

Attack with a Special Effect.

86-90

Tree, tall

The plant moves (Table 2-60) and has a Physical Distance Attack (Table 2-62) with a
special effect. However, it does not have a melee attack of any kind.

Underground bulbs

The plant is rooted to the ground. It has one Physical Distance Attack that causes
damage (Table 2-62), and it has a second Physical Distance Attack with a special effect
(Table 2-62).

It has a Physical Distance Attack, and the Physical Distance Attack has a Special Effect
(Table 2-62). Do not trifle with this plant: it will turn you into seeds and fertilizer faster

The plant has the equivalent of a mouth, which
could include splitting a large part of itself open
(like a Venus Flytrap) or even splitting its whole body
open. The mouth is the main source of damage: it
might crush its victims, or it might have the plant
equivalent of teeth, using internal thorns or spines.
A mouth with a sludgy interior might slop the victim
with digestive juices. Unless the plant is mobile and
fast, it will need some sort of motile grabbing limb to
get its victims into the mouth.

Hallucinogenic dust, spores, or smell causes victim to see
the plant as something attractive that he wants to touch.
An attractive member of the opposite sex or piles of
treasure are good examples, although the specific nature
of your adventure might suggest other ideas.

11-20

The plant has motile vines or tendrils that inflict
an unusual type of additional damage, usually
automatic and progressive if the tendrils manage to
grab and hold the victim. The following are ideas for
such damage: poison (instantly lethal, progressively
lethal, or progressively damaging), heat, cold, acid,
electricity, squeezing, and thorns.

The plant can animate other nearby plants (probably
symbiotes) so that they entangle and pull prey toward it.

21-30

The plant enfolds its victims and begins to digest
them using acidic sap or other digestive substances.

The plant uses a rudimentary form of magic to enchant
its prey. The victim walks toward the plant, and takes no
other actions.

31-40

The plant enfolds its victims and begins to
incorporate them into its own body, changing them
to plant matter or lacing them through with tiny
digestive tendrils that aren’t easily removed.

The plant uses a rudimentary form of magic to enchant
its prey. The victim will eventually be eaten, but first it
will try to pull nearby creatures (other characters) toward
the plant.

41-50

The plant’s motile limbs can cause the victim to
become paralyzed or otherwise helpless (go limp
from pleasurable narcotic, be electrically stunned,
turn rigid from a poisonous substance, etc).

The plant issues a highly attractive narcotic smell, which
causes victims to forget what they are doing and move
toward the plant.

Special Pulling Attacks

Confusion. A substance on the plant’s motile limbs
acts like a drug, causing victims to move, or even
attack, randomly.

The plant has an organ (possibly even a human-looking
eye) that functions as a gaze attack. The organ might
always be visible, or part of the plant might open up to
reveal it during combat. Those affected by the attack will
move toward the plant.

The plant has a substance (coated with sap or
slime) or an injector (thorns) on its body. Motile
limbs grab victims and carry them to the body so
that these short-range weapons can be used. The
substance causes a transformation in the victim. He
progressively turns into a “plant zombie” with seeds
attached to him, and starts traveling around while
shedding the seeds (this is how the plant reproduces).

The plant has a rudimentary teleportation ability. For an
interesting twist, try having teleportation be the result of
a failed saving throw against a Physical Distance Attack
on Table 2-61. That’s pretty darn weird.

The plant’s motile limbs stun a victim for short
periods of time when they hit (a saving throw might
or might not apply). If the limbs cause clubbing-type
damage, the stunning is simply caused by the force
of the blow. If the limbs cause cutting or piercing
type damage, then the stunning is caused by a weak
poison in the creature’s sap.

The plant zaps potential victims with a magical ray,
hypnotizing or charming them. They proceed to walk
zombie-like into the plant’s clutches.

The plant is a dangerous one, with lethal poison on
its limb attack. The poison might not be instantly
lethal, but it’s a possibility – especially if the plant
is rooted to the ground, since an escaping poison
victim won’t die near the roots. Slow poison; no
fertilizer.

The plant can grow thin roots (about the width of twine)
that crawl out very quickly from the plant’s central body.
If one of these roots manages to catch up with prey, the
central plant pumps nutrients into it, letting it thicken
to the width of a rope that can haul the victim back by
the ankles. This sort of attack makes for a good tactical
encounter, since the rootlets can grow around corners
and the party might have to divide its efforts between
attacking the plant’s central body or hacking at little
rootlets.

Acid (damage for a series of rounds, and stronger acids might
damage equipment)

Exhaled cloud (gas or mist)

Cold. Some sort of chemical reaction in the substance of the
distance attack makes it cause damaging cold. For the life of me, I
can’t figure out how this would fit into a plant’s life cycle, but it’s an
interesting thought, isn’t it?

Gas or mist (radial release in all

Disease causing a transformation in the victim. He progressively
turns into a “plant zombie” with seeds attached to him, and starts
traveling around while shedding the seeds (this is how the plant
reproduces).

21-25

Gas or mist: exhaled stream at single

Disease causing a transformation in the victim: turns into one of
these plant creatures (in a matter of days).

26-30

Horrid, massive, vomit-eruption of
liquid or goo (short range, but hits
anyone in the area)

Disease causing slow but progressive onset of paralysis (not lethal,
but the effects might last for days).

31-35

Hurls, fires, or spits: needles, thorns or
spikes

Disease causing victim to carry spores or seeds. In a matter of days,
he turns into a “bag” of spores or seeds, and explodes or otherwise
dies. This is how the plant spreads its seeds. There should be a
physical sign of the condition so the players know that they need to
get the character cured before he dies.

36-40

Ray (uses eyelike organ, eyestalks, or
other non-eyelike organ)

Disease with slow onset of death (measured in several melee rounds,
not days).

41-45

Smell (directed squirt at a single target)

Double-whammy. The victim gets an uncontrollable hunger to eat
fruit from the plant. Not only does this bring him close to the plant,
where it can attack him, but the fruit does something very unpleasant
as well, if he manages to eat it.

46-50

Smell (in a directed cone)

Hallucinations. These could cause a multitude of effects: fear,
confused and unpredictable actions, attempts to damage oneself, etc.

51-55

Smell (radius)

Heat. Some sort of chemical reaction is intended to cook the plant’s
food. Powerful versions of this might cause metal armor to inflict
damage for more than one combat round.

56-60

Spit (glob or liquid, single target)

Lethal poison with rapid or immediate onset of death.

61-65

Spit (line of liquid, ooze, or sap)

Lethal poison with slow onset (but probably causing immediate and
progressive weakness).

66-70

Spores (cone)

Mental control by plant. The substance delivered by the physical
distance attack allows the victim to perceive mind-waves emanating
from the plant, and he follows its commands. If he makes a saving
throw, he might get the interesting result of hearing the commands
but not feeling compelled to follow them.

71-75

Spores (launches a “bag” that explodes)

Non-lethal poison causing fear (flight or disorganized retreat).

76-80

Spores (line toward single opponent)

Non-lethal poison causing lethargy or slowness of action.

SAMPLE UNUSUAL REPRODUCTION METHODS FOR PLANTS
In many cases, a plant-monster’s attack method is involved with the plant’s reproductive cycle. In cases where it isn’t, and
when you want to add a bit of weirdness to the plant’s overall nature, this short table offers a couple of unusual modes of plant
reproduction to spark your creativity. Note that the primary reproductive strategy for plants is a matter of making seeds travel as
far as possible from the parent-plant.

Reproductive Cycle

01-20

The plant injects or drops seeds into the water. The seeds become tadpole-like creatures (animal or vegetable, it
doesn’t matter). The tadpoles swim to new locations using their whip-like tails. They die, and the internal seedmatter beings to grow as a new plant.

Herons
A clue was left
behind

21-40

The plant doesn’t just produce seeds – it produces flying insects (whether these are true animals or plant-insects
doesn’t matter). The insects fly about for a while, die, fall to the ground, and germinate into new plants.

41-60

By whatever means the plant might also grab hold of adventurers, it grabs birds and small animals such as
rabbits and chipmunks. It injects these creatures with seed-larva. Then it releases the small creature, which
carries along on its merry way until the larva eat it from within and germinate in its dead carcass.

61-80

The plant drops a “phase one” seed into the ground. The phase one seed grows into a small, mobile plant that
scurries away. The mobile plant proceeds to scatter “phase two” seeds as it travels. The “phase two” seeds grow
into the original plant form, which then begins to produce more “phase one” seeds.

81-00

The plant produces a shiny, gem-like seed. These are picked up by birds, which carry them away to put into
nests. When the seeds sprout, they send out little vines that feed upon eggs.

UNDEAD
In folklore, almost all undead creatures arise from some sort of break in the normal life cycle as that
culture defines the life cycle (and that’s not always the same in all cultures). Some ceremony wasn’t
performed – often burial or last rites, or some action taken by the undead person during his life rep-

although first there’s a comprehensive list of undead “types” to help you focus on the explanation,
which you might generate with the later tables. Obviously, if your “explanation” of the undead
creature generates a fantastic idea that doesn’t mesh with the type, stick with your imagination, not

VERMINOUS CREATURES
Verminous creatures are often relatively small, and are usually the “trash-collectors” of a dungeon or other area. In some cases, you might want to have larger
verminous creatures (a mutant or something), and these tables will work fine for the
larger specimens as well. However, oozes also serve well for this type of monster, and
so do the “macrobiotes.”

VERMIN MOVEMENT-SYSTEMS
Vermin are generally a “filler” type of monster, and unusual vermin are usually inspired by the pre-existing nature of the
adventure’s location. However, if you’re taking the interesting approach of getting adventure inspiration from a type of vermin,
here is one way to go about it. The following table addresses some different ways in which vermin might move around through
the adventure area. The table is probably more useful in the context of a specific adventure scenario than for the generation of a
particular species of vermin, but since it pertains to a specific class of monster it is included here.

Seen through a
glass
Hidden monster
Deliver dangerous
goods
Fey beings

Table 2-71: Vermin Movement-Systems
Die Roll

Mode of Movement

01-20

Delivery and Retrieval. Some mechanism or process in the adventure area delivers the vermin to a location
and then retrieves them (or lets them die). This is an analogy to the use of “scrubbing bubbles,” or nanotechnology. It doesn’t need to be high-tech or even well explained. Perhaps a chute simply delivers green slime
or rats to a particular location, and then spouts corrosive gas into the area when the vermin are assumed to have
eaten whatever needs to be eaten. Or perhaps a big suction-hose gathers them up after a period of time.

21-40

Dimensional movement or lairs. Whether or not the vermin have any dimensional powers that manifest
in combat, they live and/or move about through some other dimension (not another plane of existence – just
another dimension). This might be a feature of the vermin themselves, or it might be an odd feature of the
adventure area.

41-60

Requires a certain
image
Biting mandibles

Elemental association. The vermin move through an elemental plane of some kind. In this case, they
are probably elemental creatures of some kind, or a hybrid of “pure” elemental matter and normal “mixed”
material.

61-80

Through tunnels burrowed in the walls, ceiling, or floors. The standard, in other words.

81-00

Vermin infest moving monsters. Perhaps the vermin are parasites, or perhaps their larvae are dropped
from the movement of some other kind of monster (a golem?). This would keep the vermin population moving
around.

GENERAL MONSTER TABLES

OVERALL COMBAT PROFILE

This table generates an overall combat profile for a monster, regardless of type. The first column addresses the monster’s
attack profile by identifying the body parts used for physical attacks (each body type leading to a specific subtable), and the
number of special attacks the monster uses (generated on Special Attack subtables). The second column (which contains only a
small number of actual entries) sets the number of special defenses the monster uses. In addition to special defenses, the second
column sets the monster’s number of Distinctive Attributes. Distinctive Attributes can be skipped in favor of moving on to the
specific monster types after generating a combat profile.

The first step is to roll on Table 2-72. Let’s say that the results are a 20 on column 1 (for the Physical
and Special Attacks) and a 52 on column 2 (for the Special Defenses). So, column 1 gives a head, tail,
and a special attack. The 52 rolled on column 2 says that the monster has two Special Defenses and
one Distinctive Attribute.
First we roll results for the head and the tail attacks. We roll a 76 on Table 2-73 (for the head attack)
and a 17 on Table 2-76 (for the tail attack). These results indicate that we have a monster with a
horned head (one horn), and a tail that crushes and constricts. Furthermore, the monster has a
special attack. Rolling on Table 2-78 (we roll a 61), we discover that the creature emits some sort of
clicking noise, with a special-attack type of effect. Rolling on Table 2-79 (let’s say we roll a 23), we
find that the creature causes cold damage by using this clicking noise. Odd but very interesting.
Finally, we roll two special defenses on Table 2-82 and a Distinctive Attribute on Table 2-83. Let’s say
the results are a 45 and a 79 for the Special Defenses, and a 64 for the Distinctive Attribute. These
results tell us that the monster is immune to transmutation-type magic, can summon animal allies,
and that its death can curse or damage the killer.
Developing the idea: We’ve got a monster with one horn, a constricting tail, and a cold-based attack,
which basically gave me two initial ideas. The first image was a white, furry, tadpole-like thing,
which I dismissed as stupid, and the second idea was a white yeti-ape monster with a long whiptail. Neither of these is exactly what the table describes, since a tadpole-thing would technically be
crushing with its body, not a tail, and the yeti-monster would probably be getting some limb attacks
that the table doesn’t call for. That’s not a problem: go with the visualization, not the table.
Suddenly it occurred to me, though, that the tadpole idea actually works pretty well if this is an
aquatic monster. Take the head of a swordfish, give it an eel-type body with a long tail, and you’ve
got a neat, nasty, subterranean fish. It doesn’t need to be arctic at all – instead, it has a special attack
that causes cold damage underwater.

Rotting
Curse of the
Waters
Barricade of Time

The table suggests that this eyeless cave fish with its goring attack, tail attack, and cold-damage
clicking attack can also summon animal allies (more of its own kind, perhaps). I’ll go with that, but
I basically decide to discard the immunity to magic and the death-curse. The death-curse simply
doesn’t fit unless this is a really high level, almost mythological creature, and the immunity to magic
just seems like too much.
Obviously this example is just one way of approaching Part Two, but it should give you an idea of
how the tables can be used to generate a monster.

SPECIAL ATTACK DELIVERY METHOD
This table offers a higher percentage chance that the Special Attack will be delivered by touch, since the physical attack tables
(with the exception of Tongue Attacks) do not provide for the possibility of a physical attack delivering poison, acid, etc.).

Table 2-79: Special Attack Type
Die Roll

01

Acid Damage (affecting action). The attack causes acidic damage to the target, but there’s also a special
effect involved – if the victim fails some sort of check (morale, saving throw, percentile chance, etc) he takes some
action in response to or as a result of the acid (usually either due to panic or pain). The most likely candidates
for involuntary responses to acid are panic (running), losing actions (getting acid off your skin), dropping items,
or something similar.

02

Acid Damage (causes condition). In addition to normal damage and collateral damage the attack causes
to equipment, the acid has a chance to put the victim into a particular combat condition – blindness being the
most obvious, whether it’s permanent or temporary. Other possibilities for such “special” acids might include:
damaged sight resulting in combat penalties (but not complete blindness), a loss of charisma points, permanent
scarring, or some other chemical reaction (perhaps this sort of acid turns re-grown skin blue, for example).

03

Acid Damage (hit or miss). The attack causes electrical damage, but a successful saving throw means that
the target incurs no damage. In other words, the saving throw functions as a to-hit roll and if it is successful the
attack missed. Another way of handling this is to require an attack roll for the attack itself (and then don’t allow
a saving throw). If the attack hits, items and equipment spattered with the acid are at great risk of damage (this
is one of the signature features of acid as an attack form). Also, acid attacks often cause damage for more than
one round.

04

Acid Damage (progressive). The victim takes acid damage, but continues to take damage in later combat
rounds (probably a random number of rounds, but possibly a set number of rounds with declining damage
each time – it’s up to you). The continuing damage would almost certainly prevent spell casting, but might
also create penalties on saving throws, attack rolls, and/or movement rate. Also, items spattered with the acid
may be ruined. Progressive damage over several rounds (with attendant problems caused by pain) and the high
likelihood of damaged equipment are the hallmarks of fantasy acid.

05

Acid Damage (save for half damage). The target takes half damage if he makes a successful saving throw;
items he carries are also at risk of being destroyed by the acid. Generally, acid attacks are highly dangerous to
items (even more so than fire attacks) and the effect lingers for more than a single combat round.

06

Adhesiveness and Friction. The special attack makes things stick to other things, or makes them slippery.
This could be a magical power, a mental power, or it might be that the monster spits glue or oil. The obvious
use of this power is to stick people in place, prevent them from moving, or make them drop (or unable to release)
weapons. However, such an ability could also be used to give the monster extra mobility (if it slides), to haul
opponents around (if the glue is at the end of a rope or tentacle), to attach dangerous things to other things, or
as part of a characteristic trap the monster sets.

07

Affect Ground or Rock. This special attack can be used to open holes in the ground, collapse walls, cause the
ground to grab people, etc. In many cases, only one particular kind of effect will be possible; the monster might
be able to open cracks in the floor but not collapse walls, for example. Turning rock into mud (and back) is one
interpretation of this sort of ability, and so is the use of a terrible roar to collapse ceilings.

08

Affect Metal. The monster can control metal (probably one specific type). This can include causing the metal
to animate, affecting it as a magnet, making it rust, heating it up, chilling it to deadly low temperatures, causing it
to conduct electricity, shaping it at will, making it brittle, changing its physical properties, causing it to constrict,
or some combination thereof.

09

Affect Stone or Wood. This is likely a form of rapid corrosion, but it could also be the ability to cause tremors
in the substance, heat/cool it, warp it, shape it, or otherwise use it to damage people.

Special Attack

Acts of peace
Legends of Death

Affect Use of a Limb. This special attack can sever, destroy, or immobilize one of the victim’s limbs. If the
special attack is delivered by touch, this is probably a tentacle, whip, or other “grabbing” type of attack (attacks
that sever limbs should be left to the really dangerous and rare monsters). If the attack is delivered at a range (by
a gaze attack, for example), this might represent partial paralysis, a partial flesh-to-stone, or a chemical change
that doesn’t affect the entire body.
Affect Wood. The monster can control living and/or dead wood, cause it to animate, affect it like a magnet,
heat it up, chill it, cause it to conduct electricity, cause it to act like a vampiric bloodsucker, shape it at will, or
some combination thereof. In many cases, the monster will have a single, specific thing it can do, although some
more powerful monsters might have a generalized ability to animate and control wood.
Animate Objects. The monster can animate nearby objects to serve as allies. Consider a few of the following
ideas: perhaps the monster makes a specific object and has these around for use – indeed, it may be that the
creature can only animate a specific type of pre-prepared object. Some monsters might also be restricted to
animating objects made of a certain substance, made during a certain time period, or made by a certain type of
monster.
Asphyxiation. This special attack removes or reduces the target’s ability to breathe. It could be by pulling
the victim underwater, by filling the victim’s lungs with fluid, by choking the victim’s neck, by suffocating the
victim, by removing the victim’s memory of how to breathe, by surrounding the victim with dust or smoke, or a
variety of other methods. Death is not immediate, and the period of time required for the victim to die can be
measured out in several ways: a set number of combat rounds, a random number of combat rounds, a number
of combat rounds related to the victim’s constitution score, a number of rounds related to the victim’s level, or a
series of saving throws until the victim finally succumbs. Don’t worry if the character seems to be able to hold
his breath for an incredibly long time – just assume that he manages to catch a gasp of air somehow during the
process – the important thing is to make the attack work well as part of the game, not to simulate exactly how
long a person can hold his breath.

Aversion. The special attack creates an aversion to something, often an aversion to animals related to the
monster, or to situations involving the monster’s normal surroundings. For example, a giant, intelligent beetle’s
special attack might cause an aversion to beetles or bugs. Or, if the beetle is a subterranean creature, the special
attack might cause an aversion to darkness. A table of Aversions is also contained in a later book.

15

Bleeding and Healing. This sort of special attack either causes ongoing damage (probably from bleeding
or bloodsucking, but possibly for other reasons such as caustic materials) or causes damage that doesn’t heal in
the normal fashion. Ongoing damage is probably for a random number of rounds, rolling damage again each
round. A list of possibilities: bleeding caused by jagged wound, bleeding caused by blood-thinning chemical,
magical nature of bite/claw, cursed nature of bite/claw, mild poison in bite/claw/stinger, chemical reaction
continues until the catalyst is used up (like acid), or a substance continues burning or producing energy until it
is used up. (Yes, I know the last two are technically the same thing). If the special attack causes damage that
doesn’t heal normally, there are a few possibilities: (1) the damage cannot be cured by magical healing and must
be regained by normal rest, (2) the damage can only be cured by magical healing, (3) the damage cannot be
cured without a specific spell to neutralize poison, remove curse, or dispel magic, whichever seems appropriate to
the monster’s nature.
Body Infestation. This special attack infests the victim’s body with a plant or animal growth. The result
might be extremely minor: “you have fleas,” problematic, “flea bites are distracting you and causing you to
attack at –1,” or quite deadly, “an enormous flea is growing inside you: each round you attack at a cumulative
–1 to hit, and on round 10 you die unless cured.” Vermin and fungi are the obvious candidates for this sort of
attack, but this sort of attack would also include undead worms, growths that are contagious if the character
gets too close to the other characters, and a variety of other possibilities. Conditions that worsen as time goes on
work well with this sort of attack.

Bury. The attack buries the victim in some sort of substance, digs him down into the ground, or hauls up dirt
and stone to cover him. Possible substances for a burial-type attack might include slime, ashes, gravel, plaster,
hardening resin, rock, sand, and even water.

18

Charisma Loss. The attack drains one or more points of charisma from the victim. The attacker may or may
not gain a benefit from the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc) depending upon whether it seems
to fit well with the concept. If the victim reaches a charisma score of 0 as a result of successive attacks, one
of several things might happen: the victim might die and become a creature similar to the attacker, or might
remain alive as the attacker’s minion. Another possibility is that the victim just dies, and a third possibility is that
restoring the lost points becomes harder – what might have returned naturally is now a permanent condition
requiring spells or divine intervention to reverse. Note that the drain might be temporary or permanent – this is
up to you as a matter of how powerful you want the monster to be.

19

Cloud Vortex. Similar to the “Elemental” and “Energy” Vortex attacks, this is an attack in which the monster
calls forth mist, smoke, steam, vapor, fog, or some other kind of gas in a whirlwind of power. The victim takes
some damage from being hurled around, but the distinguishing feature is the effect of the substance being used
for the vortex. It might be poisonous, might be choking, might be hot, might be cold, might conduct electricity,
might dispel magic, or could have any number of other properties. The cloud probably lingers more than one
combat round, possibly trapping its victims within, possibly moving from one victim to another, or possibly just
remaining in one place as a potential obstacle during the rest of the combat.

20

Clumsiness. Victim suffers one or more of the following: a penalty to hit, a penalty to armor class, inability
or reduction in spell casting, and/or the chance to drop any items he is holding. Actual dexterity score is not
necessarily affected. The way in which the attack causes clumsiness could include overloading one of the
victim’s emotions (joy, rage, hate, greed, fear); an alchemical reaction (mysterious chemicals in the creature’s
spittle); the aftereffects of an electrical shock; or a very weak poison, curse, or disease. The duration could range
from only a couple of combat rounds to days in length.

21

Cold Damage (all or none). A blast of cold either hits or misses the target – this can be governed by an
all-or-nothing saving throw, or it might be an attack for which the attacker needs to make a to-hit roll. Cold
temperature normally wouldn’t cause much collateral damage to items or equipment unless it is an unusually
magical type of cold (perhaps affecting metal more than other substances, for example).

22

Cold Damage (manifestation). The special attack brings into being an abstract shape of pure coldness
(serpentine, mist, etc). The manifestation causes cold damage (or makes a separate attack) each round for a set
duration.

23

Cold Damage (save for half damage). A blast of cold inflicts hit-point damage, half if the target makes a
saving throw or similar avoidance check. Unlike fire, cold damage doesn’t usually risk much collateral damage
to items and equipment. Cold damage can include such things as blasting particles of ice, or visibility-obscuring
snow.

24

Cold Damage (unusual collateral damage). Cold temperature normally doesn’t affect items or substances
– at least, not in the traditional “save for half damage” type of attack. Cold attacks causing an unusual type of
collateral damage are thus quite memorable, because they’re a bit unexpected. A few possibilities include: metal
is chilled and causes damage for more than one round; potions or other liquids freeze with some sort of random
or unexpected effect; torch fire freezes; leather has a risk of turning brittle and breaking, etc.

Command Plants or Animals. The monster can command nearby plants or animals to serve as his allies.
If the monster is a plant-monster, it may have a specific type of minion-plant (possibly a weaker monster-type
with different abilities) that it can command or animate. A more powerful monster might be a general plantlord type, or perhaps it can command any sort of fungus but not other types of plants. Animal-controlling
monsters, as with plant-controllers, might be limited to specific types of animals (mammals, reptiles, etc) or
might have a particular type of animal they breed, control, or live in symbiosis with. In some cases, animal or
plant controllers (especially the ones with a specific type of ally) can turn their victims into that kind of plant or
animal.
Constitution Loss. The attack drains one or more points of constitution from the victim. The attacker may
or may not gain a benefit from the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc) depending upon whether it
seems to fit well with the concept. If the victim reaches a constitution score of 0 as a result of successive attacks,
one of several things might happen: the victim might die and become a creature similar to the attacker, or might
remain alive as the attacker’s minion. Another possibility is that the victim just dies, and a third possibility is that
restoring the lost points becomes harder – what might have returned naturally is now a permanent condition
requiring spells or divine intervention to reverse. Note that the drain might be temporary or permanent – this is
up to you as a matter of how powerful you want the monster to be.
Curse (strategic). A “curse” can be almost anything, but what distinguishes it is that it responds to particular
spells that remove … curses. If the party happens to have a “remove curse” spell handy, the special attack’s
power can easily be negated, unless this is a super-powered curse of some kind. Strategic curses are long-term
curses that don’t necessarily have much immediate effect in a combat, but have repercussions in the game
outside the realm of combat. Some of these are purely cosmetic, and would be reflected only in the role-playing
environment: a change in hair color, a long nose (perhaps it grows when you tell a lie!) – all of these are excellent
curses even though they don’t affect the game itself. Other strategic curses are those which restrict decisionmaking in between combats if they aren’t dealt with. Examples of this type of curse include a “quest to obtain
the grail,” or “give half your treasure to the evil cult.”
Curse (tactical). A “curse” can be almost anything, but what distinguishes it is that it responds to particular
spells that remove … curses. If the party happens to have a “remove curse” spell handy, the special attack’s
power can easily be negated, unless this is a super-powered curse of some kind. A “tactical” curse is one that
focuses on the basic die rolls and mechanisms of the game – “strategic” curses focus more on flavor or other
aspects of the game outside the combat rules. Tactical curses will generally accomplish one or more of the
following: (1) lower an ability score, (2) cause random actions (running, singing, etc.), possibly triggered by a low
attack roll or with a risk of onset when the character attempts a particular action, (3) cause a specific sort of
action, such as attacking allies or sleeping, when the curse is triggered by a bad die roll or other triggering event,
(4) cause a penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls, and/or saving throws, (5) give the character a small chance of
sudden death when attempting certain actions like running, attacking, casting a spell, walking into the light,
etc., (6) cause a small amount of hit point damage whenever the character undertakes a particular action such
as running, etc. (see the preceding list), (7) change the character’s location when certain events take place, either
by teleportation or by uncontrollable or random movement, (8) cause a chance of paralysis or sleep when the
character undertakes a particular action (see the preceding list), cause the character to lose a level or a particular
number of experience points (9) remove or restrict spell casting ability, (10) reduce the character’s movement.
Other tactical curses can include transformations such as polymorph or other spell-like effects such as a charm.

Dangerous Barriers. The monster can create barriers such as walls of thorns, walls of fire, bubbles of
temporary levitation, banks of whirling blades, or whatever. Here are lists of possible types of barriers and
possible types of composition. Types: wall, circle, spiral, shrinking circle, cube, moving wall, short fence, cloud,
thread, rope. Composition: fire, cold, ice, frost, earth, water, gas, blades, swords, daggers, spears, thorns, magical
force, mental force, mental domination, aversion, disease, poison, insanity, sound, song, screams, nausea, fear,
pincers, stingers, claws, confusion.

30

Death (magic or poison). The special attack uses death magic or poison to cause instant death if the target
fails a saving throw. Alternatively, targets with a minimum number of levels or hit dice might be immune to the
attack.

31

Death (progressive attribute score loss). If the target fails a saving throw, the result is likely to be death.
The victim loses a point of some particular attribute score (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom,
or charisma) periodically until the score reaches zero and death results. The process can be stopped in different
ways depending on the nature of the attack. If it is a curse, it can be removed, if it is a form of poison it can
be neutralized, if it is a form of disease it can be cured. If it is none of the above, then there might still be a
“folkloric” antidote – an action that negates the attack for no scientific reason. The most obvious example of
a folkloric antidote is to kill the attacker before the draining process is complete. Less obvious examples might
include stopping to drink lots of water, divesting oneself of all metal objects, etc. Folkloric antidotes might
completely stop the draining process or they might just hold it in abeyance.

32

Death (progressive dexterity loss). If the target fails a saving throw, the result is likely to be death. The
victim loses a point of dexterity periodically until dexterity reaches zero and death results. The process can be
stopped in different ways depending on the nature of the attack. If it is a curse, it can be removed, if it is a form
of poison it can be neutralized, if it is a form of disease it can be cured. If it is none of the above, then there
might still be a “folkloric” antidote – an action that negates the attack for no scientific reason. The most obvious
example of a folkloric antidote is to kill the attacker before the draining process is complete. Less obvious
examples might include stopping to drink lots of water, divesting oneself of all metal objects, etc. Folkloric
antidotes might completely stop the draining process or they might just hold it in abeyance.

33

Dehydrate, Desiccate, Suck Fluids. This special attack sucks blood or dehydrates the victim (possibly all
the way into powder). For “standard” bloodsucking, the process starts only with a successful to hit roll and then
the attacker causes automatic damage thereafter without rolling to hit. Consider, though, the following ideas: (1)
a “ranged” attack of this nature might be pulling bodily fluids out into a mist for the monster to collect later, (2)
a failed saving throw might mean that the ongoing damage continues until either the attacker or the defender
dies, (3) hit points don’t need to be the “measure” of the damage; it might be the character’s constitution score
or some other number that’s used for the measurement, (4) the “vampire” might gain strength (probably hit
points) from draining a victim’s fluids, (5) if the attack involves a tube or some other physical connection, you
might want to consider this as an opportunity to add some interesting tactics to the battle – perhaps the tube has
hit points and an armor class to allow the connection to be severed quickly, (6) perhaps the fluid is being replaced
with something else like eggs or control-fluid.

34

Dexterity Loss. The attack drains one or more points of dexterity from the victim. The attacker may or may
not gain a benefit from the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc.) depending upon whether it seems to
fit well with the concept. If the victim reaches a dexterity of 0, one of several things might happen: the victim
might die and become a creature similar to the attacker (this is common with undead, but a bit weird when
dexterity is the attribute score being drained). One explanation for death at 0 dexterity is that the body’s internal
systems (circulatory, etc.) are no longer working in time with each other.

Special Attack
Dimensional (imprisonment). This type of attack imprisons the victim – to some degree – in another
dimension or reality. This can be interpreted a number of different ways. Perhaps suspended animation
or catatonia can be caused by some sort of dimensional disjunction. Perhaps the imprisonment leaves an
incorporeal echo on the material plane – and it might still be able to use spells or mental powers. Perhaps the
imprisonment’s only effect is to slow the victim’s movement rate (your feet are mired in one dimension, but the
rest of you is still free…).
Dimensional (phasing). This type of special attack taps other dimensions of time and space to screw around
with the opposition’s movement. The victim is affected with some type of dimensional movement (whether
because of a disease, a poison, a curse, the opening of a synchronicity with the eighth dimension, a coating of
dimensional frictionlessness, or whatever). The effect is most likely some sort of randomization of the victim’s
movement, although it might also involve moving through solid substances (or even being able to move faster
through solids than through air).
Disease. The special attack causes a disease. Diseases can be fatal or non-fatal, can be quick-onset or slowonset, and can cause all kinds of different symptoms while the disease runs its course. Symptoms could include
losing the ability to cast spells, a penalty on saving throws or attack rolls, or whatever other interesting conditions
you can dream up.
Drain Experience (experience points). The special attack causes the victim to lose experience points.
Most likely, this is either an undead creature or a creature that can affect the victim’s memory. A third possibility,
related to memory, is a creature with some ability to manipulate time or aging. Brain-creatures, leech-creatures,
undead creatures, and dimensional creatures thus tend to be the prime candidates for this sort of power. If
you’ve got a good idea that falls outside those prime candidates, though, go for it.
Drain Experience (level). The special attack causes the victim to lose one (or possibly two) levels of
experience. This is generally a feature of undead creatures that suck away the victim’s life energy (as opposed
to creatures who affect memory, likely sucking away a set number of experience points rather than a level). A
monster with this sort of level drain should be associated with life (death) force in some way if it is not undead.
Electrical Damage (affects action). The attack causes electrical damage to the target, but there’s also
a special effect involved – if the victim fails some sort of check (morale, saving throw, percentile chance, etc.)
it takes some action in response to or as a result of the shock. Since electricity affects the brain, all kinds of
actions are credible here – it’s a much broader set of possibilities than what a fire attack might make someone
do. Possibilities include: random actions for some number of rounds, loss of bodily coordination (reflected with
combat penalties), mental disorientation (affecting spell casting and possibly even in some really cool ways like
making the character risk casting the wrong spell), temporary paralysis, etc.
Electrical Damage (causes condition). In addition to the damage caused by the attack, there is a chance
that the victim will also have a “condition” lingering after the electrical shock. This is similar to electrical
damage that causes an action, but bear with me a moment. Possibilities include: the victim has a static charge
built up that will cause damage to the next person he touches (not good if you’re the cleric, but actually pretty
cool if you’re the fighter and some of the enemies aren’t immune to electricity); the victim cannot hold an object
in his hands without dropping it; the victim is stunned, twitching, or knocked out from the electric shock, etc.
Electrical Damage (hit or miss). The attack causes electrical damage, but a successful saving throw means
that the target incurs no damage. In other words, the saving throw functions as a to-hit roll and if it is successful
the attack missed. Another way of handling this is to require an attack roll for the attack itself (and then don’t
allow a saving throw).

Electrical Damage (progressive). The victim takes electrical damage, but continues to take damage in
later combat rounds until the series of electrical shocks has run its course. Exactly what effect the continuing
damage will have is up to you. It would almost certainly prevent spell casting, but might also create penalties on
saving throws, attack rolls, and/or movement rate.

44

Electrical Damage (save for half damage). The attack causes electrical damage, reduced by half with
a successful saving throw. In general, lightning or electrical attacks don’t have the same sort of “save or burn”
collateral damage as fire attacks – or at least, they’re not generally as severe. Electrical attacks are often made
unique by the way the electricity moves around. Consider the possibility of the electricity jumping from one
target to another, the possibility of it reflecting off a wall or other surface.

45

Electricity (special). In this case, the electricity involved in the special attack isn’t normal electricity – it’s
more of a special effect for something else. Just as magical fires can do all sorts of things rather than just burn,
a strike of magical lightning or a bolt of power can be the “visual candy” for a multitude of different sorts of
attacks completely unrelated to real-world electricity. Possible effects include: lowering an ability score, acting
randomly, suffering combat penalties, following enemy orders, floating up into the air, losing the ability to act,
losing the ability to cast spells, functioning as a lower-level character, running away, suffering saving throw
penalties, suffering hallucinations, and suffering from a heightened emotion such as rage or sorrow.

46

Elemental Vortex. The special attack creates (or animates) a whirlwind of air, fire, water, or earth. In each
case, the attack causes damage from a combination of smashing into the target plus the inherent properties of
the element being used. Thus, fire would cause additional fire damage, water might drown the victim, air might
pick the victim up and move him around, and earth could possibly suffocate the victim but is more likely just
going to do more damage with the churning impact. More powerful monsters might create vortices with more
interesting results including collateral damage to equipment, moving the target a long way, pulling the target
down beneath the water or air, pulling the target into the elemental plane itself, stunning the target for some
period of time, causing the target to drop items, etc.

47

Emotion (despondency or sorrow). This special attack induces intense despondency or sorrow in the
victim. As is the case with all special attacks involving emotion, creating the details of the special attack is a twostep process concerning (1) who is affected and (2) what happens when someone is affected. Here are some ideas
about who might or might not be vulnerable: (1) anyone under a certain number of hit dice is automatically
affected but those of higher level are at no risk, (2) anyone under a certain number of hit dice is automatically
affected and those of higher level are affected if they fail a saving throw, (3) members of certain species or classes
may be immune or might be particularly vulnerable, (4) anyone with intelligence less than a certain number
might be automatically affected or might be immune, (5) those who are particularly close to the monster (or
the locus of the emotion-effect) have a penalty on the saving throw, or, conversely, everyone beyond a certain
distance gets a bonus, (6) the effect begins as a very low chance but increases as the combat progresses (a series
of saving throws or some other “check” with increasing penalties). As a list of ideas for the effect of despondency,
consider the following: (1) immobilized with sorrow, regret, grief, or ennui; (2) all die rolls are made with a
penalty, (3) character departs to go and repair his miserable life, (4) character decides to end it all, and rolls an
attack against himself, (5) character blames someone else for his miserable condition, and attacks them instead
of the monster, (6) character risks dropping dead from melancholy. One interesting idea is that if the character
escapes from this effect, he might be granted a bonus to attack the monster, in revenge. Players adore it when a
special attack gets turned around into a bonus for them.

Special Attack
Emotion (fear). The monster has a horrific appearance, changes into a horrific appearance, mentally induces
fear, or has some other way of causing fear. Fear can be portrayed in a number of different ways, in terms of
the attack’s effect, and there are also a number of different ways to determine who is vulnerable to the attack.
Here are some ideas about who might or might not be vulnerable: (1) anyone under a certain number of hit
dice is automatically affected but those of higher level are at no risk, (2) anyone under a certain number of hit
dice is automatically affected and those of higher level are affected if they fail a saving throw, (3) members of
certain species or classes may be immune or might be particularly vulnerable, (4) anyone with intelligence less
than a certain number might be automatically affected or might be immune, (5) those who are particularly
close to the monster (or the locus of the fear-effect) have a penalty on the saving throw, or, conversely, everyone
beyond a certain distance gets a bonus, (6) the fear effect begins as a very low chance but increases as the combat
progresses (a series of saving throws or some other “check” with increasing penalties). As a list of ideas for the
effect of fear, consider the following: (1) an ability score is vastly reduced until the fear goes away, (2) those affected
act randomly according to a table you prepare, (3) those affected suffer combat penalties to hit and/or on
damage, (4) those affected follow orders given by the source of fear, (5) those affected are paralyzed with fear, (6)
those affected function as a lower-level character, (7) running away (8) chance of death from fear.
Emotion (love or happiness). This special attack induces the emotion of love or happiness in the victim –
probably directed toward the monster using the special attack, but possibly as a way of immobilizing the target.
As is the case with all special attacks involving emotion, creating the details of the special attack is a two-step
process concerning (1) who is affected and (2) what happens when someone is affected. Here are some ideas
about who might or might not be vulnerable: (1) anyone under a certain number of hit dice is automatically
affected but those of higher level are at no risk, (2) anyone under a certain number of hit dice is automatically
affected and those of higher level are affected if they fail a saving throw, (3) members of certain species or classes
may be immune or might be particularly vulnerable, (4) anyone with intelligence less than a certain number
might be automatically affected or might be immune, (5) those who are particularly close to the monster (or
the locus of the emotion-effect) have a penalty on the saving throw, or, conversely, everyone beyond a certain
distance gets a bonus, (6) the effect begins as a very low chance but increases as the combat progresses (a series of
saving throws or some other “check” with increasing penalties). As a list of ideas for the effect of love/happiness,
consider the following: (1) the victim drops everything to grovel before, speak poetry to, or praise the monster (or
some other focus including other characters or shiny objects), (2) the victim tries to assist and protect the monster,
(3) the victim changes sides and follows the monster’s orders.

Emotion (rage). This special attack induces rage, either by taunting, mental manipulation, or temporary
insanity. As is the case with all special attacks involving emotion, creating the details of the special attack is a
two-step process concerning (1) who is affected and (2) what happens when someone is affected. Here are some
ideas about who might be vulnerable: (1) anyone under a certain number of hit dice is automatically affected
but those of higher level are at no risk, (2) anyone under a certain number of hit dice is automatically affected
and those of higher level are affected if they fail a saving throw, (3) members of certain species or classes may be
immune or might be particularly vulnerable, (4) anyone with intelligence less than a certain number might be
automatically affected or might be immune, (5) those who are particularly near the monster (or the locus of the
rage-effect) have a penalty on the saving throw, or, conversely, everyone beyond a certain distance gets a bonus,
(6) the rage effect begins as a very low chance but increases as the combat progresses (a series of saving throws
or some other “check” with increasing penalties). As a list of ideas for the effect of rage, consider the following:
(1) victim attacks with melee weapons and cannot voluntarily retreat, (2) the rage is a distraction, causing combat
penalties and restricting spell casting, (3) the rage gives a bonus on one hand (damage rolls, perhaps) but there
is a more dangerous penalty associated with it as well, such as a penalty on saving throws, attack rolls, inability
to retreat, inability to do anything more subtle than a frontal assault, etc. (4) the rage is so fierce that the victim
is actually paralyzed by it. It is possible that the “rage” is not automatically going to be directed at the monster
using the special attack, either: it might cause members of the party to attack each other, or it might be an
“attack” that’s used to strengthen the monster’s minions and allies (in which case, it might be a benefit with no
particular downside, like a to-hit bonus).

51

Energy Vortex. Similar to the “Elemental Vortex,” this is an attack in which the monster calls forth a
whirlwind of some kind of “energy,” including electricity, magical force, or mental force. The victim would
suffer damage, but the distinguishing feature of this sort of attack is either that the victim is picked up and
moved by the attack or is trapped inside it until they escape or the duration expires (duration might be as long as
the monster concentrates on maintaining the effect, which is not good for the victim).

52

Fire (special). In this case, the fire involved in the special attack isn’t normal fire – it’s more of a special effect
for something else. Magical fires can do all sorts of things rather than just burn, so this is a very broad category.
Possible effects include: lowering an ability score, acting randomly, suffering combat penalties, following enemy
orders, floating up into the air, losing the ability to act, losing the ability to cast spells, functioning as a lowerlevel character, running away, suffering saving throw penalties, suffering hallucinations, and suffering from
a heightened emotion such as rage or sorrow. The fire doesn’t have to be magical – it could just be that this
particular monster’s fire-breath causes people to flee, for instance. On the other hand, the whole “fire” thing
might be little more than a special effect for an attack that’s really all about floating the opponent helplessly into
the air.

53

Fire Damage (affects action). The attack causes fire damage to the target, but there’s also a special effect
involved – if the victim fails some sort of check (morale, saving throw, percentile chance, etc.) they reflexively
take some action in response to the fire. These could include: fleeing for a couple of combat rounds, trying to
put out the fire, or writhing in pain.

Special Attack
Fire Damage (hit or miss). The attack causes fire damage, but a successful saving throw means that the
target incurs no damage. In other words, the saving throw functions as a to-hit roll and if it is successful the
attack missed. Another way of handling this is to require an attack roll for the attack itself (and then don’t allow
a saving throw). Items in the area may take collateral damage (a saving throw or a “hot” effect), but only if the
target failed the saving throw – because if the target makes the saving throw, the items were presumably not
exposed to the fire in the first place.
Fire Damage (progressive). The victim takes fire damage, but continues to take damage in later combat
rounds until the fire has run its course. The attack is most likely made with a burning substance as opposed to a
burst of flame – the monster spat burning oil, phosphorus, Greek fire, napalm, or lots of burning coals – or some
sort of magically lingering fire. It is the continued burning of the substance that causes the ongoing damage.
Exactly what effect the continuing damage will have is up to you. It would almost certainly prevent spell casting,
but might also create penalties on saving throws, attack rolls, and/or movement rate.
Fire Damage (save for half damage). The attack causes fire damage, reduced by half with a successful
saving throw. Fire may also cause collateral damage to items, depending on how “strong” you want the attack to
be. If the fire causes collateral damage, you could reflect this in a variety of ways: (1) require flammable items
to make a saving throw or be ruined (or ignite), (2) decide that certain items such as cloth will automatically – no
saving throw – smolder (and cause damage to the wearer) unless time is spent extinguishing them, (3) take into
account that metal retains heat and build in some process to handle “hot” armor and weapons. The basic form
of a fire attack, though, is simply to require a saving throw for vulnerable items – whether or not the target took
half damage because he made a saving throw.
Hallucinations or Illusions (basic). The special attack causes hallucinations or illusions for those who are
affected. The illusions might be bright colors, things that appear to be changing form, or whatever – what’s
important isn’t the exact nature of the illusion but the effect it has on general combat (more complicated illusions
are treated in a different category). The easiest way to come up with basic illusion/hallucination attacks is to
determine first what they do, and then figure out what sort of illusion might create that effect. Possible results
of a basic hallucination are as follows: (1) lowering an ability score while the hallucination is operating, (2) acting
randomly according to some table of actions, (3) suffering combat penalties to hit, (4) following enemy orders or
orders generated randomly by a sound-hallucination, (5) losing the ability to take any actions due to fascination,
nausea, confusion, etc., (6) functioning as a lower-level character as a general way of reflecting that the character
is distracted, (7) running away or moving randomly in response to the hallucinated reality, or (8) suffering saving
throw penalties. As a basic example of thinking up the illusion based on the result: a hallucination which causes
an attack penalty of –2 might be an illusion which blurs the outlines of the character’s sight or shifts his vision
slightly to the side of where things actually are. In addition to the combat-type basic illusions, there is another
category of basic “camouflage-type” illusions used by ambush-monsters – these illusions don’t necessarily create
any sort of combat modifier, but they make the monster seem innocuous until it is ready to attack or lead the
party toward some attractive-looking goal where the monster has an advantage. These would include monsters
that are invisible, monsters that can make themselves look like stone walls or statues, a monster that can make
people think it’s a treasure chest, etc.

Hallucinations or Illusions (complex). The special attack causes a hallucination or illusion that is too
complex to be characterized with a modifier to die rolls or a table of random actions. An illusion of mirror
images (giving the monster’s opponents the chance to be attacking the “wrong” monster) is one example; another
example is a hallucination that might cause damage to the victim, and a third example is a hallucination that
creates the image of a deep pit between the monster and the victim. In general, these fall into the following
categories: illusions that create false enemies, obscure or change the appearance of the enemies, create
illusionary obstacles, create illusionary dangers (the appearance of a spell being cast, fake attacks, or some other
type of illusionary assault), or otherwise prevent the victim from getting true information about the tactical
situation. Exactly how these are handled is up to you – if the illusion is unusual, you might choose not to follow
the “official” method for handling illusions, if your game has one. There is a wide variety of interesting ways to
handle illusions, including saving throws, a “check” against intelligence or wisdom, or simply telling the player
what the character sees and leaving it to the player to respond. In some cases, depending on the illusion, the
way to handle it will be obvious; in other cases, the same illusion treated differently might as well be a different
kind of special attack. Feel free to let your imagination roam: what sort of illusion might you create if you were
a monster? One last point: there is a big difference between a monster that creates one specific illusion (mirror
images, for example) and one that can create all kinds of illusions in response to the circumstances. The latter
type of monster is very powerful, and you might want to think of its abilities in terms of spells rather than a
general ability to create illusions.

59

Ice (blasting). This sort of attack is partially about the cold temperature, but there’s a “blasting” component
to it as well. Such effects could include: knocking the target backward, knocking the target prone, blowing items
out of the target’s hands, etc.

60

Ice (immobilizing). This sort of attack isn’t all about the temperature; it will probably cause some hit point
damage, but the main feature of the attack is that it uses frozen water to immobilize the target. It might be
creation of a block of ice (“it froze the air itself !”), or it might be a matter of breathing a storm of ice particles
that create a block, wall, or chunk. If the monster is very powerful or highly magical, the ice might have other
dangerous properties – suffocation, ongoing damage, or a chance of instant death from hypothermia all being
possibilities.

61

Immobilize (by an activity). Although many of the special attacks listed here would have the effect of
immobilizing the victim, this entry addresses immobilization-type attacks as a group. Here is a series of activities
which could cause a character to be effectively immobilized: dancing, twitching, laughing, vomiting, nausea,
confusion, jumping, floating, talking, scratching, begging for mercy, thinking, arguing, holding one’s breath,
hiding, and meditating.

62

Implant Eggs or Young. This special attack implants the victim with eggs or larvae, or in some way makes
him into a host for the attacker’s reproduction – which can include a magical transformation into the same
sort of creature (possibly independent, possibly a minion of the attacker). There are several possible variables
to work with when designing this sort of special attack. First, the trigger – it might be that a successful hit
automatically begins the process, it might be that there is a saving throw required after each hit, it might be that
each hit has a percentage chance of causing the effect, or it might be that the “egg-laying” effect only happens
when the victim is dead, knocked unconscious, or rendered helpless by the attack. Secondly, the remedy – the
process would be counteracted differently depending on whether the “eggs” are considered a poison, a curse, or
a disease. Thirdly, the gestation period – it might run from only a couple of combat rounds to more than a week
in duration (giving the adventurers much more time to find a remedy back in the civilized world). Fourthly, the
effects during gestation – perhaps the victim remains unconscious or in suspended animation until the eggs hatch
(or his body alters, or the implanted creature eats its way out, or whatever), perhaps he can wake up and function
normally until his sudden demise as a character, or perhaps you can think of one or two “stages” of the process
in which the victim becomes weaker or changes as a result of being used as a host organism.

Special Attack

63

Insanity (strategic). “Strategic” insanity, as opposed to “tactical” insanity, is a form of insanity in which the
effects aren’t bundled up in the game rules, but are reflected in the roleplaying and in the non-combat side of the
game. Examples include various phobias, aversions, and manias. Hysterical blindness is another good example
– a condition that can suddenly appear when the character is under stress.

64

Insanity and Confusion (tactical). The special attack drives the victim temporarily or permanently insane.
The characteristic example of this sort of attack is confusion, which causes victims to act according to a random
table.

65

Intelligence Loss. The attack drains one or more points of intelligence from the victim. The attacker may
or may not gain a benefit from the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc.) depending upon whether it
seems to fit well with the concept. If the victim reaches an intelligence of 0 as a result of successive attacks, one
of several things might happen: the victim might die and become a creature similar to the attacker or become a
mindless host for the attacker’s larval offspring (mind-leeches, or whatever). Another possibility is that the victim
just dies, and a third possibility is that restoring the lost points becomes harder – what might have returned
naturally is now a permanent condition requiring spells or divine intervention to reverse. Note that the drain
might be temporary or permanent – this is up to you as a matter of how powerful you want the monster to be.

66

Light, Dark, and Shadow. The monster uses light, darkness, or shadow as a special attack. Consider some
of the following: (1) a floating weapon or dangerous coalescence of light or darkness, which attacks once brought
into being, (2) creates darkness to effectively blind the enemy, (3) blasts of damaging light, (4) the monster can
compress and concentrate light or darkness to make some interesting form of attack.

67

Luck. This special attack gives the victim bad luck (reflected with die roll penalties). The question is: what
sort of bad luck? Is it just a curse that makes you inflict less damage, or is it a wide-ranging effect that doesn’t
just make you miss opponents but also means you always get a fly in your beer at the local tavern? In addition
to whatever specific die roll modifier this attack causes, some monsters might deliver bad luck in very specific
categories: the “beautiful” type monster might deliver a curse of bad luck with the opposite sex; the earthelemental type monster might deliver bad luck involving gemstones; the dryad-like creature might give bad luck
outdoors, or involving wooden items.

68

Magic Drain (items). The special attack drains magic items of their power (and might or might not give the
monster additional power as a result). Items can be drained temporarily or permanently, and they can also be
drained in a way that gives them a chance to fail when used as opposed to being completely “dead.”

69

Magic Drain (spells). The special attack removes, to some degree or other, a spell caster’s ability to cast
spells. The attack might remove a single spell from the caster’s mental inventory, it might remove all spells, it
might remove particular spells, it might remove spells of a certain level or higher (or lower), or it might lower
the caster’s effective level of experience. Alternatively, the attack might cause all the caster’s spells to function
sub-normally, or create a chance of failure when the caster tries to cast a spell. In the case of powerful monsters,
draining spell power from a caster might also strengthen the monster; giving it extra hit dice, hit points, or a
combat bonus. In the case of extremely powerful monsters, whatever spell was drained might actually go to the
monster and give it the ability to cast that spell.

70

Magic or Mental Force (slam). The special attack uses magical force or telekinesis to smash the victim into
something, or smash something into the victim. This includes hitting the victim with magic force alone (i.e.,
no actual object). This is a broad category: the attacker might or might not need to make a to-hit roll, and the
defender might or might not have the chance to avoid the blow with a saving throw or other means of lessening
the damage. More powerful versions of this attack might do one or more of the following: push back the victim,
hurl back the victim, make the victim drop items in hand, stun the victim, knock the victim unconscious, or even
have a chance to kill the victim outright.

71

Memory (steal ability). This special attack allows the monster to use some ability or skill known by the
target. The most obvious example of this is casting a spell, but combat bonuses or other advantages could be
targeted by such an attack. Even the victim’s target number for saving throws, for example, could be “stolen” if
it is more favorable than the monster’s normal target number. It is also possible for a memory-affecting special
attack to target only the magically related memories of a target, stripping away spells or spell casting abilities but
leaving combat and other skills unaffected. This more specific type of memory attack would generally be found
in creatures with some relation to wizardly magic (e.g., created in a wizard’s lab, bred to fight wizards, etc.), a
relation to divine or unholy power (e.g., the monster is a remnant of some ancient divine retribution, is a parasite
of divine power, etc.), or feeds specifically on magic power.

72

Memory Drain (experience). Memory-draining special attacks are generally targeted at the victim’s level or
experience points. The attack would either remove (temporarily or permanently, depending on how you decide
to design it) one or two levels of experience or a set number of experience points.

73

Movement Inhibited (external). Some sort of very weak binding or entangling inhibits the victim’s
movements. Victim suffers one or more of the following: a penalty to hit, a penalty to armor class, and/
or reduction in spell casting ability (perhaps only “easy” spells, perhaps a chance of spell failure, perhaps an
increase in casting time). There is probably also some reduction in the victim’s movement rate. The nature
of the binding force can include: filaments of magical energy, thickened air, vacuum power or wind, clothing
becoming brittle or cumbersome, etc.

74

Movement Prevented (external). Some sort of binding or entangling prevents the victim from moving. The
severity of the attack can range from complete helplessness to merely being held in one place (but otherwise
able to take actions). The nature of the binding force can include: filaments of magical energy, thickened air, a
coagulated blob of magical glue, a natural adhesive, swarms of infinitesimal spirits holding the victim in place,
the stones of the floor grabbing his ankles, a spider web, or animated vines or tentacles.

75

Open Planar Gate. The monster can open a gate into some other reality. This could be an escape
mechanism, a way of summoning allies, or a way of blasting the area with weirdness from the other plane.
Even a fairly mundane little mole-like critter becomes interesting if it can burrow into the tenth dimension and
come out behind you. Indeed, if it can open a gate through time, it might be able to come out and attack you
simultaneously from two different places (of course, then it would disappear for a few moments since it used
itself as a special attack a few moments earlier…). If a planar gate is used to summon allies (again, keep in mind
that even minor monsters – like a planar ant – might be able to summon more of their own kind). If the gate is
an escape mechanism, perhaps it’s possible for the adventurers to follow the monster into some strange and alien
realm where it makes its home – and possibly has a different bodily form.

76

Paralysis. The special attack causes paralysis for a random number of combat rounds, minutes, or hours. A
very powerful monster might cause permanent paralysis as a form of curse, poison, or disease.

77

Poison (lethal). Lethal poisons cause death, but death is not necessarily immediate. A slow-onset poison might
cause some sort of debilitating effects during the onset period (such as the victim being incapacitated with pain,
or becoming unconscious), or it might simply cause a progressive weakness that isn’t reflected in terms of the
game’s numbers… until the character drops dead.

78

Poison (non-lethal). Non-lethal poisons can have a variety of effects: some might be temporary effects until
the effects of the poison have worn off, but others might be permanent debilities until some sort of magic has
been used to reverse the damage caused by the poison.

Special Attack
Raise, Create, or Summon Undead. Undead monsters aren’t the only ones who can use undead monsters
as allies or minions. More importantly, not all undead must necessarily be undead – a statement which obviously
requires clarification. Animated bodies need not be the result of black magic (which is the case for, say, the
standard zombie). But what about bodies animated or controlled by a plant – is this technically an undead
zombie? Will it necessarily work in exactly the same way as an undead zombie just because it’s a moving human
corpse? If your answer is “no,” then you’ve just opened up the realm of the plant-undead, the virally-controlled
undead, the mechanically-controlled undead, the psionically-controlled undead … all kinds of creepy minions
and transformations that can be used to develop monsters and their abilities.
Senses (overstimulate). The five senses are sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, and each of them
could be overstimulated by a monster by means of a special attack. I don’t necessarily mean that the monster
is hideously ugly, sounds awful, feels awful, tastes awful or smells awful, although if one of those trips off an
inspiration, then run with it. What’s meant here is that the monster affects one of the victim’s senses to make
it too powerful for effective use. For example, if the special attack affects the victim’s sense of smell, all smells
might become so powerful that the victim falls prey to nausea. If the attack affects sight, the victim might be
overcome by light sensitivity or have vision so microscopic that he can’t perceive what’s happening around him.
Since there is a wide variety of possibly “effects” stemming from sensory overstimulation, here is a quick list of
possibilities to get the mind working: (1) temporarily lowering an ability score (or all ability scores), (2) acting
randomly, (3) suffering combat penalties, (4) losing the ability to act due to nausea, fascination, or confusion, (5)
functioning as a lower-level character, (6) running away or moving randomly, (7) suffering saving throw penalties,
(8) dropping any items held in hand.
Senses (remove capability). The five senses are sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Only sight and
hearing have much effect in game terms, so I’ve just lumped them all together into one entry on this table. The
special attack causes blindness (or makes lots of things invisible), or it causes deafness (or keeps sound from
functioning in the area) – alternatively, it removes the sense of touch, taste or smell from the target (or negates
feeling, taste or smells within the area of effect).
Size and Density. The special attack changes the size or density of the victim (and a beneficial form of it
might also be usable to help allies if the monster is a leader-type). Growing and shrinking allies and enemies
respectively is a fairly obvious use of this sort of ability, and it’s easy to generate a set of modifiers as required.
Manipulating density and weight is a bit more open ended. Can the monster make people weightless so they can
levitate or be levitated? How about too heavy to move? Perhaps the effect only works on metal or some other
substance.
Sleep and Catatonia. The special attack causes magical sleep, normal sleep, catatonia, or suspended
animation. In some cases the effect might be automatic against targets with a lower number of hit dice (or
levels), or it might permit a saving throw. It could also affect only those with intelligence or wisdom lower than
a target number, or affect only a certain total number of hit dice within an area. Onset is probably immediate,
but it would also be possible that there’s an intermediate, “sleepy” phase in which the victim is still functioning
with combat penalties before actually falling into the magical sleep. Powerful sleep-type attacks might induce
this “sleepy” condition even if the victim makes a successful saving throw. In some cases, particular dreams, or
dreams sent by the attacker, might be an important part of the attack in addition to putting the victim to sleep.
Slow. This sort of special attack slows down the victim, probably to half speed at everything, but possibly only
in terms of movement or attack speed – it depends on how the monster does it. The effect might just be magic
which slows down opponents, it might be related to manipulation of time or other dimensions, or it might be
that the monster produces an external cause like glue or webs that slow people down.

Sound (action-causing). The monster speaks or makes sounds that compel certain actions in the unfortunate
listener. This isn’t control by the monster, because the monster can’t fine-tune anything, but in many ways the
effect is the same. Examples include: approaching the monster, becoming paralyzed, running away, removing
armor, attacking, hiding, etc.

86

Sound (control). Many folkloric monsters use sound to control others – whether by means of song, speech,
or spell. There are many ways to represent different degrees of mental control, and many ways to determine
whether a person is affected. For example, degrees of mental control include: (1) victim follows all commands
like a puppet, (2) victim sees the controller as his friend but will not put himself into mortal danger, (3) controller
can only command the victim to perform certain actions, but other actions don’t fall within the scope of the
magic – for example, a monster that can “call” the victim to a certain place, but can’t order the victim to attack
its enemies. In terms of ways to determine if a target is affected, here is another list of possibilities: (1) anyone
under a certain number of hit dice is automatically affected but those of higher level are at no risk, (2) anyone
under a certain number of hit dice is automatically affected and those of higher level are affected if they fail
a saving throw, (3) members of certain species or classes may be immune or might be particularly vulnerable,
(4) anyone with intelligence less than a certain number might be automatically affected or might be immune,
depending on the nature of the sound/persuasion being used, (5) anyone within hearing gets a saving throw, (6)
those who are particularly close to the sound have a penalty on the saving throw, or, conversely, everyone beyond
a certain distance gets a bonus. The duration of sound-control attacks is another factor that can be used to
create different types of challenges: in some cases, the control might end as soon as the sound ends, but in other
cases the control might be established irrevocably.

87

Sound (distraction). The monster uses speech, sound, or song to distract or immobilize its enemies. It may
be that the sound itself is so discordant or so beautiful that it creates the distraction, or it could be that the sound
evokes such a strong emotional response that the victim acts strangely or fights poorly. To run through these
variables: if the sound or speech evokes an emotion, these could include joy, rage, hate, greed, fear, or adoration.
The effects of such sound attacks could include: (1) temporarily lowering an ability score, (2) acting randomly,
(3) suffering combat penalties, (4) following enemy orders, (5) losing the ability to act, (6) losing the ability to
cast spells, (7) functioning as a lower-level character, (8) running away, (9) suffering saving throw penalties, (10)
suffering hallucinations – or a combination of more than one of the above.

88

Sound Damage (save for half damage). Sonic damage is a little hokey, but every once in a while it works
(particularly with monsters based on real-world animals that use echolocation or are known for producing a
characteristic sound. Sonic damage ordinarily wouldn’t cause collateral damage to items or equipment, but
glass is a natural candidate for being damaged in this way. I recommend avoiding the concept of sonic damage
– sound works much better for mental control, combat penalties, preventing spell casting, and other such special
effects than it does with the concept of taking actual hit point damage. At all costs, avoid thinking of sound
damage in terms of vibration and frequency, and start thinking of it in terms of song and screech – or you’ll
make a serious misstep in terms of the “feel” of a fantasy game. This is even true if the monster is from the
“voids between the stars” or from an alternate high-tech universe.

89

Spell-like Abilities. The monster has a set group of abilities that function as spells, probably with a limited
number of castings per day, per hour, per minute, or whatever. Unlike true spells, it may be that all monsters
of this type have exactly the same spell-like abilities and can’t change them from day to day (to my mind, this
is what distinguishes “spell-like” from “spell,” but what’s important here isn’t to create clean categories, it’s to
muddle things together for maximum creative boost). Spell like abilities are normally, but not necessarily, best
when all the abilities are obviously related to something about the monster. A monster from the elemental plane
of fire should have mostly fire type abilities, and (interestingly) it is the non-fire abilities that will tend to make it
stand out in the players’ minds. If a fire-genie has several fire abilities but can also use mind-control, that’s very
distinctive. But if it has too many non-fire-related abilities, it may fail to be memorable.

Spells. The monster uses spells or can use its special attack to deliver spells from a list identical to a magic-user
of some defined level. Different monsters of the same type might have a different “selection” of spells.

91

Strange Chemical (affects items). The special attack releases or creates a chemical that affects non-living
substances. The affected substance might be wood, leather, paper, fires, metal, water, air, potions, magical
ink, hair – the choices are pretty wide-ranging. The chemical reaction either destroys the substance, makes it
multiply, or changes it into something else – and the interesting part might be the side effect of the reaction, too.
Many chemical reactions give off energy, suck energy out of the air, create gases, and do all kinds of strange
things. Most likely, the chemical reaction will change the liquid/gas/solid composition of a substance, or change
it into another form (iron to rust, leather to powder, wood to stone, etc.).

92

93

Strange Chemical (affects person). The attack creates a chemical reaction of some kind – either the
chemical is sprayed onto the victim or the attacker’s gaze causes chemicals in the victim’s body to change,
or whatever. This is a huge category of possibilities, because a “chemical reaction” can explain any result
whatsoever, especially if you throw in words like “enzymes,” and even more especially if the monster is
from another plane of existence, another time, or from the “voids between the worlds.” On the other hand,
traditionally folkloric monsters like griffons or dragons shouldn’t have quasi-scientific explanations for what they
do – use magic. Quasi-science is best for weirder monsters. Possibilities for strange chemical reactions include:
lowering an ability score, acting randomly, suffering combat penalties, following enemy orders, floating up into
the air, losing the ability to act, losing the ability to cast spells, functioning as a lower-level character, running
away, suffering saving throw penalties, suffering hallucinations, and suffering from a heightened emotion such
as rage or sorrow. Another way of looking at it is to think in terms of transformations: these could include skin
turning into metal (or getting crusted with metal), gases that might be given off, medical symptoms (hemophilia),
and factors such as weight, density, friction, adhesion, or release of energy.
Strength Loss. The attack drains one or more points of strength from the victim. The attacker may or may
not gain a benefit from the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc.) depending upon whether it seems
to fit well with the concept. If the victim reaches a strength score of 0 as a result of successive attacks, one of
several things might happen: the victim might die and become a creature similar to the attacker, might just die,
or might just lose the ability to naturally restore the lost strength points. Note that the drain might be temporary
or permanent – this is up to you as a matter of how powerful you want the monster to be.

94

Stun. The attack uses some kind of “special effect” to stun its victims. Possibilities include noise, electric shock,
an ugly appearance, mystical rays, visions of the future, hallucinations, powerful emotions, a floating symbol,
light, and the old standby … a powerful physical impact.

95

Stupidity. The victim does not actually lose points of intelligence or wisdom, but his thinking is impaired
enough to cause penalties on various actions. Spell casting is probably prevented entirely, but a weak version of
this sort of attack might only prevent casting “harder” spells – or all spell casting might be subject to a chance of
failure. This sort of attack could also lead to combat penalties: inability to use both a weapon and a shield at the
same time, perhaps a to-hit penalty, etc. The way in which the attack causes stupidity could include distraction
by overloading one of the victim’s emotions (joy, rage, hate, greed, fear); an alchemical reaction (mysterious
chemicals in the creature’s spittle); the aftereffects of an electrical shock; some sort of mental numbing; sapping
away the thoughts themselves; or a very weak poison, curse, or disease. The duration could range from only a
couple of combat rounds to days in length.

96

Telekinesis and Teleportation. These special attacks are used to move enemies into bad places and smack
them with things. Powerful monsters will be able to use the power more flexibly: for example, a brain-lord
might be able to choose how far and when he wants to teleport himself of a target, but a brain-munchkin might
teleport a specific distance at random intervals with no ability to teleport an enemy at all.

97

Transformation (basic polymorph). The special attack turns the victim into an animal or some other
form (such as an object). Stronger, smarter, or more magical creatures might have the ability to choose
what form they will polymorph victims into, while other monsters might only have the ability to turn people
specifically into frogs. The duration of the transformation is fairly important – does it end when the attacker is
killed, does it end after a set duration, or is it permanent? Another consideration is whether the victim retains
his own mind (and the player if left controlling a rabbit) or whether the change is more than just a change in
outer form. In some cases, the attack might be part of a one-two punch; if the monster controls all wolves, and
can turn people into wolves, the attack can be used to turn enemies into allies – giving the other party members
the dilemma of whether to attack their polymorphed-and-controlled ally.

98

Transformation (basic substance). This special attack changes one substance into another or changes the
state of matter. (See Table 2-73)

99

Weakness. Victim suffers one or more of the following: a penalty to hit, a penalty to damage, and/or the
chance to drop any items he is holding. Actual strength score is not necessarily affected. The way in which the
attack causes weakness could include overloading one of the victim’s emotions (joy, rage, hate, greed, fear); an
alchemical reaction (mysterious chemicals in the creature’s spittle); the aftereffects of an electrical shock; sapping
of willpower; or a very weak poison, curse, or disease. The duration could range from only a couple of combat
rounds to days in length.

100

Wisdom Loss. The attack drains one or more points of wisdom from the victim. The attacker may or may
not gain a benefit from the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc.) depending upon whether it seems
to fit well with the concept. If the victim reaches a wisdom score of 0 as a result of successive attacks, one
of several things might happen: the victim might die and become a creature similar to the attacker, or might
remain alive as the attacker’s minion. Another possibility is that the victim just dies, and a third possibility is that
restoring the lost points becomes harder – what might have returned naturally is now a permanent condition
requiring spells or divine intervention to reverse. Note that the drain might be temporary or permanent – this is
up to you as a matter of how powerful you want the monster to be.

First phase is egg-layer, eggs hatch into food-finder, food-finder transforms into mating form (traveler and
possibly fighter for mates), mating form transforms into egg-layer.

51-60

First phase is egg-layer, second phase combines food-finder, warrior, and mating form, second phase cocoons or
otherwise transforms into the egg-layer type.

61-70

First phase is the egg-layer, second phase is made up of three separate morphological forms: food finders,
warriors, and mating form of one sex. Warriors transform into egg-layers in the right season, which the matingform members compete over.

71-80

First phase is the egg-layer, second phase is made up of two morphological types; neuter workers and a
“hermaphrodite” warrior-mating form. These warriors probably fight a lot, since otherwise a hermaphrodite
form would create lots of population. A failure of this fighting cycle could lead to a horde forming, which could
be a nice adventure hook. Perhaps the hordes are periodic, too.

81-90

Hermaphrodite form lays eggs and then dies; half the eggs hatch into a traveler-defender form that goes out to
build nests for the other half of the eggs. Second half of the clutch hatches into more hermaphrodite egglayers.

91-00

Mating form lays eggs and dies; eggs hatch into a traveler-defender form which goes out to build new nests or
hives, then cocoons or transforms into the mating form. One form probably builds nests, and the other one
probably picks nice nests and fights over them in competition (health, fighting ability, plumage, etc.). The two
mating-forms might look utterly different, here.

INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER THREE
The previous two books of this series contain tables that are designed to spark ideas: the first book addressed missions and
villainous plans, and the second book focuses on monsters. This third book, on the other hand, takes for granted that you have
already chosen the starting point of a subterranean setting, and provides a vast array of tables designed for this specific type of
adventure. Part One addresses certain general elements that are key to any adventure, subterranean or not, and the remainder
of the book is specifically about adventures in the dark depths of the earth.

THE CREATIVE
PROCESS
DUNGEON DESIGN

There are four general steps in the creative process of
designing a dungeon adventure using this book. Don’t try to
follow them as a checklist, but it’s useful not to go into the
process completely blind, especially when your brain starts to
hurt. The steps are:

Overload

Synthesis

Sculpting

Building

Ants
A thing that turns
Aquarium
Circle of beliefs
Unexpected
loyalty
Secondary trap
Forbidden rites

CREATIVE OVERLOAD
When you start using the tables in this book you will
immediately encounter “overload,” a ridiculous mishmash
of adjectives and concepts that contradict each other, sound
stupid, and pile upon each other in an excess of details. This

CREATIVE OVERLOAD
At the beginning of Lewis Carroll’s “Jabberwocky,” everything is unformed; nonsense
words crowd upon the reader to form inchoate images. It’s brillig, we know, and there’s a
mishmash of undefined activity – slithy toves
are gyring and gimbling all over the place,
or at least in the wabe, possibly elsewhere.
Mome raths are outgrabing, apparently independent of all the action at the wabe. The
borogoves are in a state of mimsiness. The
reader is in a state of confusion. This part of
the poem corresponds to creative overload,
and Lewis Carroll is doing it on purpose, just
as I do in this book.

is actually a vital step in the creative process. Somewhere in
your life you have probably encountered the institution of the
“Brainstorming Session.” The idea of a brainstorming session

is to get several people together with a chalkboard, easel, or

no idea is impractical – at least, not at this point. This phase

starts to gather strange threads of ideas, little connections

of a brainstorming session corresponds to the overload of

between some elements of the “there are no stupid ideas”

stories, adjectives, names, and concepts generated by using the

mishmash on the chalkboard or easel or whatever. This is the

tables in this book. As an adventure designer, you don’t have

point in the adventure-design process where you will start to

a creative team to sit down and generate a host of ideas – you

get flashes of visual imagery, and notice that certain elements

have to do it alone. This book provides the equivalent of the

In the next stanza of the Jabberwocky, a
theme begins to develop. There is a father, a
son; threats to their well-being have surfaced
to disturb this otherwise brillig place. There
are one or more jubjub birds, a wandering

No wonder the borogoves mimse; wouldn’t

our art. This is the point where you have a dungeon with one
name, a level of the dungeon with another name, a part of
that level with yet another name, plus a load of items and architectural elements with long strings of adjectives attached to
each and every one. Not only that, but most of the adjectives
are vague or even ambiguous.
Because I designed them that way.

In the final stanza of the “Jabberwocky,” Lewis Carroll wraps it all up. You’ve got a gleeful
father, a son who’s triumphant enough to do a
bit of galumphing, and, all told, it’s a pretty damn frabjous day. The nonsense words
fit, now, and the reader can figure them out.
From the perspective of the reader, the poem
now sculpts itself backward into a story. In
retrospect, the nonsense all makes sense.
The poem is finished, bringing order out of
chaos. From your perspective as an adventure
designer, you’re working on something that’s
structurally a bit different from a poem,
since our task here is more open-ended. For
instance, there might be a conspiracy of drow

sible for this bad-idea piece of home furnishing. Scrap “inimitable,” because you’ve already got what you need. Here’s a
different take on the throne, though. What if it was a project,
not an item? Maybe it’s part of the backstory, Zar’s effort to
imitate a throne he’d seen described in an ancient book? Hey,
maybe it’s a red book, and the trap isn’t about the physical
throne, it’s about the book. Put some of Zar’s journals into the
dungeon for the players to find, describe a storehouse full of
trap components the characters can use against monsters, and
you’re ready to rock along a completely different direction.
Ambiguity is your volleyball: toss it around before you spike it
into the court.

SCULPTING
In the third, fourth, and fifth stanzas of the
Jabberwocky, the initial mishmash of the first
stanza gets resolved into a thread of purpose
and action – even a bit more geography, although the exact location of the tumtum tree
relative to the wabe is … vague at best. Still,
two points define a line, so the geometricians
will be comfortable even if the cartographers
remain deeply unsatisfied. And a line gives
you a direction. Position yourself at a point
on that line (don’t use a tumtum tree – it’s
been done), do a bit of uffish thought, and
then it’s time to take your vorpal sword and
begin cutting out what doesn’t belong. Snicker-snack, and we are on to the next phase.

BASIC ELEMENTS OF ADVENTURE DESIGN

A hawk
Altered

Chapter One has already introduced a series of broadly stated elements for a masterpiece adventure, creating a sort of check-

list (see the Side Box). This section, down here all the way in Book Three, is about “how to build,” not “what to end up with,” so
it has a different set of factors. The Book Three approach reflects the fact that all the elements described in Book One are actually, in practice, all mixed up together when it comes to creating them. They only resolve themselves into nice, neat, categories
once the process is finished and the results are polished up.

OVERVIEW OF THE
BASIC ADVENTURE
ELEMENTS
Certain elements appear in every good adventure, and if
one of them is lacking, you have missed an opportunity. Most
adventures focus more heavily on some elements than others,
and the different emphasis of one element over another can
create highly distinct adventures. However, each element is a
dimension that should not be entirely omitted, even from an
adventure that is dominated by another element. For example, an adventure designed to be a high-tension race against
time will still suffer if the combats don’t contain interesting
tactical elements. An adventure that focuses on an extremely
creative new monster will still suffer if it takes place on a boring map. Keep these in mind while designing the adventure,
and use them as a checklist after you’re done, because some
degree of attention should be paid to each of these factors:
• The Time Element: some sort of race against time, possibly a major factor, possibly a minor factor
• The Motivational Element: what makes the players
choose this adventure
• The Information Element: what do the players start out
knowing, what do they learn while adventuring that can
help them, and what previously unknown thing have they
learned at the end
• The Tactical Element: what sorts of physical features are
the memorable “standouts” in the adventure, and how
can the players use these to their advantage
• The Monstrous Element: who or what is actively fighting
back?
• The Movement Element: is your map well designed as a
game board?
• The Miscellaneous Element: other types of challenges

THE TIME ELEMENT: RACING AGAINST TIME
The most important feature of any adventure is the race against time. Virtually all good adventures contain some sort of race against time, although the degree to which the race against time is a feature
of the adventure can vary quite a bit. In a lair-type adventure, a pressing race against time can be used to
prevent the adventure from dragging. On the other hand, in a mega-dungeon where player choice
is at its maximum, the race against time might be little more than limitations on food and light, hit
points and spells. Every delay to check for secret doors or inspect areas for potential traps increases
the risk that the adventurers will be attacked and weakened by wandering monsters before they can
find one of the dungeon’s treasure hoards, but the pressure of a rescue or a villain’s plan coming
to fruition isn’t used to create any further time constraint. All these elements; the traps, the secret
doors, the wandering monsters, and the treasure hoards come together to create a low level of time
pressure that keeps things moving without building tension to a high level. Both methods of structuring the pace of an adventure can create an enjoyable gaming session.
It is worth noting that one adventure type reverses the “race against time” concept, and that is the “hold out for reinforcements” type of adventure in which the characters are under a siege of some kind but can expect help if they can hold out long
enough. In this case, it is the monsters, rather than the players, who are faced with the adventure’s underlying race against time.

THE MOTIVATIONAL ELEMENT: “SELLING” THE ADVENTURE
TO THE PARTY
Another very important factor in all adventures is making the players want to undertake the adventure. Unless you want
your campaign to be an endless series of situations in which the characters are forced into adventure after adventure dint of
blackmail, high-handed kings, and other “railroading” devices, you will need to entice the players into choosing the “prepared”
adventure of their own free will. Good refereeing is a matter of letting the players choose their courses of action, but that
doesn’t mean you can’t dangle the carrot in front of them to nudge them toward the adventures you’ve planned. Your adventures should be posed as opportunities, not necessities. Of course, every rule is made to be broken from time to time, but in
general you should think about two things: (1) the players should see – and you have to communicate – the opportunity for a
dramatic, interesting good time, and (2) you should play to the ever-present player motivations of experience and gold, which are
the underlying forces of motivation embodied in the game rules; or to the desire for fame or moral achievement, which might or
might not be important factors to your individual players. Make sure that the players can see and perceive the adventure as an
opportunity to gain fame, fortune, and buckets of gold for their characters. They’ll take the bait every time.

THE INFORMATION ELEMENT
A good adventure begins with snippets of information the players can use, should provide both useful and useless clues in the
middle of the adventure, and conclude with (or develop as the adventure progresses) some sort of “revelation” that most people
don’t know. The revelation doesn’t have to be anything earth-shattering; it could be as simple as the fact that the monsters came
into this area because there is a famine in their normal hunting grounds. In many cases, the revelation is either why the area
became dangerous (see Tables 3-6, 3-7, 3-8 and 3-9 for ideas) or the fact that the monsters are actually in the service of some
greater threat. In many cases, the revelation of this underlying mystery may be the starter knowledge for another adventure if
the players decide to act upon it, but this isn’t necessary and can actually begin to feel formulaic if the “new adventure hook”
becomes a standard feature of each and every one of your adventures, session after session.

THE TACTICAL ELEMENT
Certain types of challenges are common to all adventures, whether wilderness or subterranean. The table below can be used
for minor challenges (similar to solving a trap or trick) but they can also be used to get ideas for the sorts of large challenges that
define a mission. For instance, the entry “close” on the table might be used as the solution for a minor trick, or it might spark the

idea of closing a planar gate that has been unfortunately or untimely opened.
Every adventure should have at least a couple of real showcase locations, but these aren’t necessarily tactical. They might be
something that’s just visually striking, or a really interesting “boss” monster, or a mental challenge. Even if it’s not one of the
showcase locations, though, an adventure should contain at least one area where pure skill on the part of the players has a huge
effect on the outcome of a combat there.

TACTICAL SITUATIONS
Tactical situations are built mainly upon the premise of getting yourself into the best position to gain an advantage. A more
subtle use of tactics is not only to place yourself to best advantage, but also to push the enemy into a position of disadvantage.

Major hazard at a particular point, surrounded by area of high risk and reward: this might include a
“brainstone” that requires anyone within ten feet to make a saving throw or fall into babbling idiocy for several
hours – but anyone making the saving throw gains a major bonus on to-hit rolls, or can “see” what the enemy is
doing through their own eyes for several hours. Getting to it first would provide a major advantage. This sort of
tactical goal allows the players to make significant decisions that can affect the outcome in unusual ways; should
they take the risk, or not?

you survive intact enough to do so. Once again, tactics is all about maximizing player decision-making

28-30

Areas in which standard abilities are weakened: ability scores, etc.

31-33

Particular weapon required, usually an odd one. This might be in a “death arena,” or a monster might have a
particular vulnerability, or a curse might make it impossible to use all non-clay weapons, or the characters might
have lost their normal weapons and are forced to improvise.

34-36

Areas in which standard abilities are altered (underwater, for example)

37-39

Areas in which potential shields rise and lower (walls, actual shields, wooden partitions, etc).

40-42

Areas which rise and sink in a predictable fashion: being in the right place at the right time gives you the
advantage of the high ground – but not forever, because the platform or whatever will sink back down again.

43-45

Areas in which shifting visual partitions close off line of sight: mists and fog banks would be an example.

46-48

Situations where unusual vehicles or modes of movement must be used: hang-gliding using huge leaves, or
teleporting from disk to disk would be examples.

49-51

Situations where the effect of movement is partially random (affected by gusting winds, tides, or small
teleportation errors, for example).

52-54

Situations where explosives can be set off (rooms with scattered barrels of flammable oil, for example). Players
love chain reactions from explosions, too.

THE MONSTROUS ELEMENT
The actual creation of monsters is covered in chapter 2; as is their motivation, if you consider them to be a collective “villain”
and roll on the tables for villainous motivations in Book 1. Treated as a structural element in an adventure, however, the most
important “rule” is that every adventure should contain some combat elements. It might be tempting from your perspective as the referee
to create an “all traps” challenge, or an adventure pitting the characters against the elements. But your players, unless they’re an
unusual group, will want some diversity in the type of challenge their characters encounter. Single-themed adventures can get

Teamster

motion

very boring very quickly, from the perspective of the players.
Other than the fact that there should be a monstrous element, the major thing about structuring monsters into the adventure
is diversity of challenge. Vary the number and type of monsters in different encounters. An adventure in which one combat
after another is against the same type of foe, or against a single foe, is much less compelling than one in which there are several
types of monsters of varying levels of power, some alone, some in large bands.
It is not necessary to have one “boss” monster running the show, and it is not necessary to have a single monster act as the
“climax” of an adventure. However, it is a good idea to have one combat that’s abnormal, more difficult, or otherwise more
memorable than normal. A showcase, if you will. If you survey your finished adventure and find that all the encounters are
roughly of the same difficulty, or take place in nondescript rooms, or that none of them involves an interesting tactical feature,
think about adding some more spice to whichever combat has the most potential.

Here’s an odd tip – take it or leave it. As a matter of pacing the adventure, so that it has highs and lows, it’s my opinion that
an adventure should contain some completely mundane, average encounters. These standard-issue combats have the same

the way

purpose as comedic breaks in a horror movie: they re-set the tension level so that the next “big” thing has more impact. As with
most things involving the monstrous element, we’re once again talking about variety and diversity. If everything is cinematic,
nothing is cinematic. If everything is special, nothing is special. A few “standard” encounters will make the unusual encounters
more memorable, somehow. It’s purely psychological; but then, so is most of adventure design.

THE MOVEMENT ELEMENT: DESIGNING THE MAP
Creating a good map is one of the most important features of designing an adventure, because the map is, effectively, the
game board for all tactical movement in the game. Always return to the fundamental question: does this map work as a game
board? Because this ultimately is the measure of a map: it is the way it will be tested, and the way in which the players will
interact with it.

TIPS ON MAP DESIGN
I can’t claim credit for all these tips; I’ve received many of them from other people:
1) A map should not be a linear pathway through the adventure. As with all things in an adventure, the key is to provide
meaningful decisions for the players to make. If your map is viewed as a flow chart, and it has no “circular” paths allowing
different ways through, then you may want to build in more choices.

Rotting
Draped with color
Tactics: piles of
bricks

2) The map should be roughly divisible into areas with only one or two ways into each area. This gives the players the
psychological reward of getting “into a new area,” and it also means that as a game board you have created a choke point for
tactical movement. The entrances and exits to areas become significant places on the board where enemies can be bottled up or
pathways can be blocked off.
3) Try thinking of the map literally as a game board with some squares labeled things like “go back two spaces,” or “you can
buy this property,” or “advance to go, collect 200gp.” Fill your mind with all the labels you’ve ever seen for game boards. Evaluate whether your map would be fun to use in a game where dice are rolled for movement and you do what it says on the various
squares. Alternatively, re-envision your map as a flow chart if that’s the way you think. Are there several different pathways
through this map?

A meteorite
Surrounded with
vermin
A swindler
Necromancy
Melting point
Cleric

4) Use the third dimension, with up and down movement somewhere on the map.
5) Vary the physical features in various parts of the map. In dungeon adventuring this means having rooms of different sizes
and shape, corridors of different widths, and even areas with odd features like high ceilings or areas where there is flooding. In
wilderness adventures, physical features can be varied with different colors of rock, different plants or animals, different rock
formations, etc.
If you keep these five tips in mind while creating a map, you should be able to create a “flow” that maximizes the map’s tacti-

players at the table. However, as with most structural elements of an adventure, change-ups are required to vary the pace and

scores, and the like. Otherwise, those character sheets don’t mean much. Sometimes, traps or tricks might have a random
particular type of challenge: how to avoid being tested, or how to cope when something goes wrong. Again: the primary sort of
challenge is a test of player intelligence and skill; tests of the character sheet are the exception and the spice, not the rule or the
main dish.

Nature of Challenge

01-25

Ability Checks: A situation requires the player to roll a d20 and score equal or lower than his character’s
appropriate ability score. NOTE: in general, intelligence checks should not be used – it is the player’s
intelligence that should solve problems. Strength, dexterity and constitution, the physical attributes of the
character, are generally the best scores to use for “ability checks.” Avoid using ability checks when a situation
isn’t high tension or difficult. Tying knots in a rope to climb a wall just isn’t the sort of thing that needs a
random factor injected into it.

26-50

Flat chance: These sorts of challenges aren’t affected by the character sheet or anything else. There’s just a
specific chance per person that the effect will happen: whether the chance is 1 in 6 or a percentage is up to you
as the referee. These sorts of challenges are often used when the players are deciding whether or not to risk
something like walking over a rickety bridge. The random factor is used to determine when the bridge falls. So,
the flat chance die roll isn’t the test of player skill; the test of player skill is whether or not to take that chance in
the first place (and how to improve the odds with gadgetry or other innovations).

51-75

Random Selection: having the player pick a card from a set of five, play a game of blackjack or a game of
craps, or choose which hand a coin is in. Do you pick what’s behind curtain #1, curtain #2, or curtain #3?
There’s no skill involved here, obviously, but challenges like this add spice to the game. Sometimes, deciding
whether or not to play the game, or which player will play, is where the exercise in player skill comes up.

76-00

Saving Throw: Whereas ability checks are only linked to the physical characteristics of a regular person,
some challenges are challenges to the character’s experience. Ability checks don’t take the character’s level into
account; saving throws do. Keep in mind that at lower levels, a saving throw is difficult to make.

PART TWO:
DESIGNING A DUNGEON ADVENTURE
INTRODUCTION TO PART TWO
In keeping with the rest of this series, my objective is to provide creative sparks for adventure design by pressing lots of
concepts and elements into the reader’s mind so that the creative subconscious can make sudden, new combinations of them.
Dungeon designing is such a vast topic that I’ve organized these conceptual clouds into topics, so when the designer is struggling
for inspiration in a particular area he can dip into the specific section or sections that seem to be the closest to what he’s looking
for. This mode of organization loses a bit of the lightning-strike power of joining together utterly dissociated concepts, but I
think it ultimately makes the book more usable.

A FIRST, AND IMPORTANT, DISTINCTION: LAIRS AS OPPOSED TO MEGADUNGEONS
There are basically two types of dungeon adventures: the short ones where a mission can be accomplished and finished within a small dungeon (which I call a “lair”), and the huge dungeons designed
for an almost infinite number of game sessions (which I call a “megadungeon.” Most of the tables
in this book are applicable to both types of dungeon adventures; however, if you are designing a
mission-oriented lair adventure, you should keep in mind that anything in here relating to the extent
and size of the dungeon may generate an area that is too large and too empty for a faster paced,
mission-oriented type of adventure.

MYSTERIES AND CLUES
THE CONCEPT OF MYSTERY IN A DUNGEON ADVENTURE
As a starting point for the discussion of dungeon design, it might seem strange to begin with the concept of mysteries and
how to evolve what the players know about the dungeon. But an adventure doesn’t just develop in terms of area explored or
monsters killed; it also develops in terms of the players gaining more and more information about the situation and the location.
Sometimes this knowledge has no practical application in game terms, but make no mistake – it is intensely satisfying to the

players if they gain more understanding about things. Even the best-designed adventure in the world will fail on a critical level

if they get scraps of information about who lived in the place, what their names were,

if the players finish the adventure with no sense of ever having understood what the hell was
going on. Even in a megadungeon type of adventure, it is highly rewarding to the players
what happened to them, and why the megadungeon eventually became the province
of deadly monsters instead of the original creators and delvers.

UNDERLYING TRUTH:
THE BACKSTORY
A backstory is the history of events that have taken place, both significant and trivial.
Backstories are necessary in order to generate clues and rumors about the dungeon, because you’ll
need something for these clues and rumors to be about. For many designers, knowing the backstory of an area
is also a strong spur to creativity.
There are several approaches to creating a backstory, and the tables in this section are all alternatives for each other – it
doesn’t work to combine the results from more than one table in this particular section.

EXAMPLES OF ITEM-BASED BACKSTORIES
Using Table 3-7, one might get a result of: “A statue or idol was introduced in order to cause a problem, with the additional factor of family identity.” The question is how to dream that into the history of a dungeon (or any other sort of adventure you might be planning). The easiest assumption,
since we’ve got the tried-and-true dungeon standby of the statue, is that the thing was introduced
into the dungeon. Clearly, someone provided the statue in order to cause problems, and the only
matter to resolve is what sort of problem a statue might cause for family identity. There are various
possibilities that can be generated solely from that one entry:
The title to ownership of a castle (with the dungeons underneath) was contested between two members of a family, the Azon branch and the Zeon branch. According to the Azon branch, Argos Azon
was born before Zaun Zeon, but an ancient statue in the dungeons shows an older Zaun standing
next to a younger Zeon. As minor elements, you might introduce evidence of the battle into the
dungeon, and a few scraps of paper about which son was older. As a more major element, you might
decide that the benevolent and kindly Azon family was displaced by the evil and sinister Zeons, with
effaced murals of the Azons, broken statues, etc.

workable
The lure of

Religious

Dangerous healing

On the other hand, the same backstory elements could be used to build a dungeon history in which
an individual is trying to claim that he is a member of a powerful family. The family cannot allow this because the person is a pirate, or a murderer. Since there is an old statue of some family
member who looks almost exactly like the roguish newcomer, the family arranges to have the statue
hidden away in the depths of a dungeon beneath their castle. Since the outsider is a pirate, perhaps
he launches a recovery mission – and if he’s a pirate, he should do it by boat, right? That immediately gives you the idea of a river running through the dungeon map. So in this case, the backstory can
directly give you an idea not just about the dungeon’s history, but some inspiration about the map
itself !
A third possibility, just to illustrate how flexible this table can be, is to look at these results from a
completely different direction than the examples above. Perhaps the priesthood in a deep subterranean community (possibly not even human) is hereditary, and another family challenges this ancient
tradition. An idol in the dungeon gives out oracles and signs, and there is some sort of convocation
called in which the idol is called upon to resolve the question. Here you’ve got an idea about what
the mysterious statue does, possibly some sort of theological dispute, definitely the idea that religious powers might be involved, and all sorts of other possibilities…

TYPES OF INFORMATION
The following tables about information are not just for generating
adventure ideas; they are for use throughout the adventure design process.
There are three ways the players in their guise as characters might encounter information:
1) Clues: things the characters see and must interpret
2) Rumors: things communicated directly to the characters (whether true, false, incomplete, or embroidered)
3) Written Information: clues and rumors that are recorded in some form

A characteristic of
the stag
A binding of
spirits

CLUES
Clues are bits and pieces of incomplete information that the players (characters) perceive directly and must interpret. It is

Weevils got into
the flour
Like a worm
Gargoyles
Uses a specific tool

best to make their solutions fairly obvious; it’s much more difficult to figure things out from the player side than one might think,
especially when you aren’t paving the way for them with things like “an intelligence check.” And don’t do that! Die rolls used to
substitute for players thinking and deduction will rob the players of the feeling of joy and accomplishment when they figure something out.
But on the other hand, if the clues are too difficult, you also rob the players of the same feeling of accomplishment – it’s fine
to provide some hard clues that conceal really useful information, but most clues should be quite simple. It’s also obvious, I
think, that the difficulty of the clue should correspond to the usefulness of the information it reveals.

61-70

Recent painting or carving: some sort of decoration has been added. This obviously indicates recent use of
the area, and probably an intention to stay. A corollary question is why this particular sort of decoration was
chosen and whether it indicates the type of creature that chose it. Keep in mind that paint might be covering or
concealing something, and statues can also be used to conceal doors, trapdoors, and holes in the floor. They can
be faucets for gas, or counterweights.

71-80

Warning signs: these might be painted “Keep out” signs, or might be as primitive as a skull on a post. They
indicate borders and boundaries, and may disclose the nature of the creatures that put up the sign. They might
also indicate clues about who is being warned away.

81-90

Operating machinery: whether the machine is a water channel or a piece of incomprehensible complexity, if it’s
operating then someone turned it on and maintains it.

91-00

Furnishings and carpets: if an ancient area has new carpeting, someone is nearby. Carpets can conceal other

PART OF DECORATIONS
Sometimes, information can be gained by looking at a portrait (“hey, isn’t that a map she’s holding?”), a statue (“that sword in
his hand looks like the one we found earlier”), and even furniture (“that is a really, really, big chair”). Putting clues into decorations just doesn’t really translate into a random generation table, unfortunately.

REMNANTS OF AN EVENT

Table 3-15: Type of Event Leaving the Clue
Die Roll
01-10

Agreement or treaty: the obvious evidence of a treaty or agreement is the document itself, if it was the sort of
agreement one writes down. Other written evidence can be a letter in which the agreement is mentioned or is
obvious.

11-20

Battle: battles and combats are usually evidenced by the presence of broken arrows, possibly bloodstains, and in
some cases the evidence of spell casting.

21-30

Betrayal: visual evidence of a betrayal is a bit hard to manage, unless a mirror or some other magical device
recorded the event for posterity. A letter is one way of accomplishing this kind of clue, or (depending on the
adventure) the clue might be something like an opened entryway that was supposed to keep enemies out.

31-40

Cave-in: either the area is completely blocked, or it has been cleaned out and a lot of rock is missing. Note
that wooden structures can also collapse. Why did the area cave in, what might it hide, and who is responsible?
Does it indicate that the ceiling above the party’s heads is unstable; does it indicate that the enemies around
the corner have rigged explosives, or does it mean that earth elementals are rampaging in the area? Add some
details, and you have a good clue.

41-50

Execution: there’s a dead body, or a stake with scorch marks around it, or a skeleton hanging from a noose, or
some other sign that an execution took place. Why did it happen? That’s not necessarily part of this clue, but if
it’s just a random piece of “dungeon dressing,” then you’ve missed a good chance to convey information to the
players for future use (or further knowledge about the location and events there).

Table 3-15: Type of Event Leaving the Clue continued
Die Roll

Type of Event (d100)

51-60

Fire: why was there a fire? An execution, arson, evidence of a fire-using monster? Does it reveal the location of
a trap, does it show that combustibles were stored here, or does it reveal something else?

61-70

Flooding: an area is full of water, or there are signs that it once was. This could include a waterline stain,
seashells in a dry area, fish bones, or other such evidence. Why was the area underwater? To kill people? To
store water for drinking, experiments, or fire fighting? Perhaps there is a secret door at the waterline used for
access to the sea or an underground lake. Possibly an aquatic monster once lived here. Possibly the ceiling is
about to open and flood the chamber while the adventurers are looking around.

71-80

Functioning of a trap: this is also covered in evidence of mechanism or use. Here, instead of the sort of
markings left by a mechanical device, we’re probably talking dead bodies.

81-90

Imprisonment: evidence of imprisonment could include a skeleton chained to a wall or in a cell; it could include
written records of a jailer, and it could include scratches left on the wall by a prisoner. These are just a few of
the more obvious examples.

91-00

Lovers’ tryst: evidence of a lover’s tryst might be quite blatant; such as a love letter, or a rumpled and recently
vacated bed; or it might be relatively subtle, with clues such as a coded love letter, or the smell of a distinctive
perfume somewhere it isn’t supposed to be. The identities of the lovers might not be apparent until this clue is
connected with another clue.

Keep in mind that the capital letters of the alphabet referred to in this table are meant to identify a set of basic line shapes,
not letters. If they resemble letters too much, your rune is going to look too modern and the elements of it will be too obvious.

An unspoken
agreement

These are basic starter-shapes, not letters.
Pickled peppers

There are some tricks to help you overcome this difficulty. The first trick is to alter the “normal” line lengths involved in
drawing a capital letter of the alphabet – i.e., the proportions of the letter. The second trick is to draw the capital letter partly
using straight lines and partly using curved lines. The third trick is to vary line widths in the rune, making some lines thicker than
others. This third trick generates more artistic and magical-looking runes, but can generate crappy-looking results until you get
the hang of it. Stretch normal dimensions and add curlicues if your rune is still looking too recognizable.
One experiment for varying line widths can be done by going to an art supply store or a craft store and getting hold of an artist’s “crow quill” pen. A crow quill is a pen you dip in ink, with a very narrow nib. When you are drawing a normal line, the line

is extremely thin; but by adding slightly more pressure the line will widen. An experienced artist would use a larger nib pen or
a brush for this, just to get a bigger final picture, but a crow quill is easier for a beginner because the small nib makes it easier to
control ink flow. The more ink your tool can deliver to the paper, the cooler you can make your results, but it also makes it much
easier to screw up. I definitely recommend starting with a crow quill – and they also have the advantage of being cheap.

CODES AND CIPHERS
Codes and ciphers can be a great tool in an adventure, but if they are too difficult they can cause a big problem, too. In

Lighter than
expected
Hidden motives

general, remember that what looks easy to the referee is probably a lot harder for the players to figure out. Keep codes very, very
simple if the players are actually supposed to decode them, and provide the key somewhere in case the players can’t figure it out,

Sorcery

or lose patience.
Four different types of codes/ciphers are described below. Each method can be used to generate a variety of actual codes.

Farmer

1) Shuffle the letters of the alphabet forward or backward by a specific number (this is called the “Julius Caesar Cipher”).

Blood flows
downhill

Example: if the shuffle-number is 2, then the letter “A” would be written as “C,” which is 2 letters forward in the alphabet. The
letter “C” would be written as “E,” and so forth. If the writer wanted to write AC in this cipher, he would write CE.
2) A more complex form of cipher is to assign a number to each letter of the alphabet. The simplest version of this cipher
would be to assign the numbers as A=1, B=2, C=3, etc. “ABC” in this code would be written as “123.” A stronger code might
have a key to show the letter-to-number relation. “A” might be assigned arbitrarily to the number “5,” “B” might be assigned
to the number “1,” and the rest of the letters would also be given numbers to represent them. From the standpoint of writing
an adventure, this sort of cipher would be really annoying to the players because it’s simply too hard or too time-consuming to
break without the key. If you don’t have the key easily available somewhere for the players to find, avoid ciphers that will take

Prideful

thumb at you, sir
Djinni
Ruby capsule

monster

too much time to break.
3) Letters can be substituted for other letters according to a key; these codes are extremely difficult to break without having a
copy of the key.

Long ago and far
away…
Structurally
unsound

4) A message can be embodied in an innocuous communication using a formula like this one: “every tenth word is a word of
the real message. Ignore all other words.” A more complicated formula would not use the same interval. Such a key might read
as follows: “the words of the message are words number 10, 15, 30, 41, 50.” In this case, the key would probably be necessary
for players to be able to break the code – although it might be workable if (a) the players enjoy puzzles like codebreaking and (b)

they know from somewhere that the nature of the code is to use words at intervals.

ALTERNATE ALPHABETS AS EASY CODES
An additional form of code is simply to use a different alphabet for normal writing, requiring the players only to figure out
the transliteration. This approach adds mystery into the dungeon, but is relatively easy for the players to figure out if you label
several innocuous rooms with the alphabet before presenting the players with an important piece of information. Some usable
alphabets are shown below. Note that the third column is (pretty much) the Greek alphabet, and can be transliterated by anyone
knowing that alphabet; Tolkien fans or scholars of Norse might also be able to transliterate the Elder Futhark runes of the first
two columns.

There are a vast number of fantasy fonts available on the Internet that can serve as a code alphabet. The Autorealm Phoenician font used in the above table is one of these, taken from the Autorealm mapping site. Hieroglyph fonts, Hebrew, and pictograms are also good if you don’t want to provide any clues by using letters with similarities to their modern equivalents. Script
fonts that connect letters are much harder to decipher, since the players won’t know where one letter ends and another begins, so I
don’t recommend these.
Many player will be aware that “e” is the most commonly used letter in the English language, since this knowledge was well
disseminated in the Sherlock Holmes story, “The Dancing Men.” Making the letter “e” recognizable will go a long way toward

players to figure out. It is good planning to have the solution available somewhere else in the adventure, and NEVER make
solving a riddle the only way for the players to proceed all the way through an adventure.
The easiest way to create a riddle is to follow the steps below:
Start with the answer you want, such as, “horse.”
Jot down the distinctive characteristics of the thing you’ve chosen as the riddle’s answer. A horse, for example, has four legs, a
mane, a tail, carries a rider, has hoofs, etc. This is a brainstorming step; write down everything you can think of.
Consider ways of describing these characteristics in a vague or poetic manner. For example, a horse is a land-strider. Because
a person sits on it, it can be “man’s throne.” And its iron-shod feet make sparks when they strike stone. Thus, “Land strider,
man’s throne, sparks fly when I step to stone.”
Take a shot at putting a rhyme or two into the riddle. It’s not necessary, but the impact is far better.

THE MAP
INTRODUCTION
The various sections of this part of the book are organized in the context of a random dungeon generator, but they are actually intended to be used separately, when you are looking for a bit of specific inspiration about some feature in a dungeon you
aren’t generating randomly. The other possible way of organizing them was alphabetically, and I decided that as a creative tool,

Deceptive image
Priest-killer
A characteristic of
the wolf

it would be better to provide some connection between the elements instead of presenting them in isolation. Even if the designer
is initially looking for an isolated element, the connections themselves might serve as an independent source of inspiration.

QUICK INSPIRATION
If what you’re looking for is just a quick inspiration for “what comes next” in an existing dungeon, it’s a bit irritating to be

Cocoon

faced with an entire dungeon-generation system. There are a couple of quick ways to get ideas for “what comes next.”
Starting wherever you need some inspiration (the edge of your existing map), and go directly to Table 3-23 to generate ideas
for the transition into a new area. Once that’s done, go to Table 3-37 to see what’s on the other side of the transition area. Table
3-37 generates the general layout of a set of rooms and chambers, and can be used to generate the shape and sizes of those
areas.
Another possibility is to jump all the way down to Tables 3-78 and 3-79 and see which one of them you like best (these two
tables are similar but alternate methods). Table 3-78 offers general ideas for what might come next in a dungeon, without many
references to the tables. Table 3-79, on the other hand, is designed to direct you back into the tables – it is like a master table for

Slightly dented

mushrooms

jumping randomly into the tables. In other words, Table 3-78 is for use if you’re feeling pretty creative, and Table 3-79 is for use
if you want to treat this whole section as a grab-bag of tables instead of a step-by-step process.
The third alternative is just to browse through the tables until something catches your eye as an interesting idea.

HOLISTIC DUNGEON GENERATION
Every method I have seen for generating random dungeon maps is a linear “walk” through the dungeon’s passageways, with

of creating a dungeon map, in which the designer has a bit more influence over the process as it develops. At the very least, this

if you’re pressed for time, and it can certainly provide you with flashes of inspiration. There is, however, a somewhat better way
means you won’t have to erase big parts of the map as often as you do when using a linear generator. At its best, it allows you
as the dungeon designer to integrate your own creative processes more easily into the overall pattern of random results as that
pattern develops.

THE CONCEPT OF DUNGEON AREAS
A dungeon “area” is a set of rooms (or chambers, or caverns) that are separated from other groups by only one or two connections. In other words, the dungeon map is “granular,” made up of distinct pieces. There are several reasons for constructing
a dungeon map in this fashion: the small number of connections makes each one tactically important for escape route and
ambushes, and because the areas are segmented, the players themselves gain a sense of excitement when they realize they have

Redemption

discovered a new area of the dungeon. The dungeon level has regions, rather than being a single, undifferentiated whole.
Perhaps as importantly, dividing the dungeon map into such segments allows you, as the designer, to apply your different
creative inspirations in small bites. It is much easier to work several different ideas into a dungeon level when there are naturally
existing borders to separate one idea from the next.

ARRANGING THE AREAS

A mistake in the
formula

The first step in designing a dungeon holistically is to create the arrangement of the areas (groups of rooms) and their connections.
The dungeon is divided into areas, and each area is connected to others by a “transition.” Choose an arrangement of the areas from the options below. The lines are the transition areas, the square box is the starting area, and the circles are areas found
beyond the starting area. It is a good idea to sketch the resulting diagram (or one you create) onto a full sized sheet of paper,
because you will probably be writing notes about each circle and line before you move on to creating a real map.

Each line on the dungeon’s chart of areas is a “transition,” that can be as simple as a door or as bizarre as a teleportation
device. Roll for each transition line on your chart, determine if there is a trick associated with it, and note that all down next to
the line.

* If the Transition is to a special seventh area, add +20 to the die roll, treating any result over 100 as an architectural trick.
If the result is a normal door (including secret and concealed normal doors) then there is a 100% chance of a complex trick
being associated with it. For all other results for transitions to a seventh area, the chance of a simple trick is 75%, and if there
is no simple trick then the chance of a Complex Trick is 100%.

DOORS AND ARCHWAYS

ARCHWAYS

Secret identity

Whenever a tunnel or corridor leads out of a room, there is presumably some sort of archway, so when an “archway” appears
on a table or gets marked on a map it’s because there is something unusual, noticeable, or distinctive about it.

DOORS
NORMAL DOORS
Just because a door is “normal,” i.e., not concealed, secret, or opened by means of a complicated method, doesn’t mean it
can’t be unique. This is especially true of doors that connect two major “areas” within a dungeon.

DEFINING AND DEVELOPING DUNGEON AREAS
This section of the book is about building and detailing small pieces of the dungeon map – whether or not you’re using the
“Holistic Dungeon Generator.” If you are using the Generator as a tool, then defining and developing the areas of the dungeon
is the next step after generating the transitions between them.

AREA TOPOGRAPHY
Without getting into over-specific categories like the difference between lava tubes and limestone river-caverns, there are only

ARRANGEMENT OF ROOMS/CAVERNS WITHIN THE AREA
Arranging the elements of a dungeon area is the most difficult part of the process. Roll on the table below to determine the
abstract description of how the rooms are arranged. This table doesn’t specify the length of any interior corridors or which
things are directly connected, so all these arrangements can yield very different results (see the diagrams that follow the table).

A central room has one or more “suites” entering into it; the rest of the rooms in the area are part of the suites.
Each suite is a self-contained group of interconnected rooms (each room is not, of course, connected to all the
others, but most rooms will be connected to more than one other room).

Ancient division

11-20

A main corridor branches into two (either as a Y or a T shaped junction). The rest of the rooms in the area are
in suites entering into one of the corridor’s branches. Each suite is a self-contained group of interconnected
rooms (each room is not, of course, connected to all the others, but most rooms will be connected to more than
one other room).

21-30

A single connecting corridor has one or more “suites” entering into it; the rest of the rooms in the area are
part of the suites. Each suite is a self-contained group of interconnected rooms (each room is not, of course,
connected to all the others, but most rooms will be connected to more than one other room).

31-40

All rooms enter onto a single, central corridor that makes one or more turns along its length

41-50

All rooms enter onto a single, straight, central corridor

51-60

All rooms enter onto one central room (probably a room of unusual size, if one is present)

61-70

All rooms enter onto the corridors of a central T-junction or four-way intersection.

Connecting corridor forms a square, circle, or rectangle (i.e., it surrounds an internal area). About half the
rooms are enclosed by the corridor, and the other half enter onto the outside wall of the corridor.

81-90

Connecting corridor forms a square, circle, or rectangle (i.e., it surrounds an internal area). All rooms are inside
the enclosed area. Rooms may interconnect directly with each other, or might not. The internal area need not
be completely filled by the rooms, and the surrounding corridor might make turns along its path before closing
the “circle.”

Two central rooms are connected to each other by a corridor; all other rooms enter onto one or the other of the
central rooms

Orcs

The name for an area, if you want one at all, might occur to you while you are mapping or populating it. However, if you
want some additional ideas at the beginning, the following tables can be used to come up with interesting and evocative names
for a particular part of the level (or possibly for the entire level, if you wish).

PLACING LANDMARKS
Each level in a large dungeon should have landmarks in it. Just as with the
fractal-type arrangement of the map into areas and transitions between
them, landmarks continue to nail down the map’s geography: without
landmarks, the dungeon map risks being perceived by the players as an undifferentiated whole, where exploration is a boring process with no meaningful
discoveries to be made. Landmarks in general include:

• Big Things (See Table 3-49)
• Level Changes (See Table 3-50)
• Strange Things (See Table 3-53A and Table 3-53B)
• Special Rooms (See Table 3-54)
• Water (See Table 3-77)

crown?

LEVEL CHANGES (LANDMARKS)
Don’t create dungeon levels like a computer game, where there’s one way down to the next level and virtually the entire level
needs to be explored to get there. If you’re using the “holistic Dungeon” method, put in about one level change per two “areas.”
Also keep in mind that not all level changes need to be stairs. Some of them can be the equivalent of traps, taking the adventurers completely unawares!

Unusual Aspect of Stairs (d100)
Stairwell changes position to lead to different locations (either depth or different locations on a particular level)
based on pattern of steps taken by first person descending/ascending the stairs. Example: normal step-stepstep leads to location 1, but two steps down and one step back causes the stairs to lead to an entirely different
location.

SPECIAL ROOMS
Special Rooms are simply the rooms with more detail to them than just monsters, treasure, and/or bits of dungeon dressing. They don’t have to be super-dramatic (that’s more the role of Big Things and Strange Things), but they should generally
be interactive or provide information, one or the other. In some cases they might incorporate tricks or traps, but beware – you
don’t want to make every interesting room contain something dangerous, or the players will eventually assume that every room
containing more detail than a broken arrow on the floor is a risk. Leave many of these rooms to be nothing more than … interesting.

NPC INTERACTION
Although NPC interactions are really more of an encounter type than a feature of the dungeon itself, they are important not
to forget as one of the ways to make a room “special.” If you’re only designing the permanent features of the dungeon at this
stage, just roll a different result on Table 3-54.

Nature of NPC (d100)

Primary Potential Value to Party
(d100)

01-10

Adventuring, exploring, or
seeking treasure

Astonished and happy to
see a human face in this
godforsaken place.

Can remove a specific curse the party is
likely to have contracted at this point in the
adventure (this is likely coupled with another
primary benefit, since the curse was probably
involved in getting to the NPC).

11-20

Currently imprisoned

Friendly, possibly for no
particular reason.

Gives Information (Roll on Table 3-17 for
content of Rumors)

21-30

Group of human type
creatures that are completely
disorganized

Hostile and ready to fight

Has a key or other physical item that will be
useful for getting to a treasure, past an obstacle,
or into an otherwise inaccessible area

31-40

Group of human-type
creatures with a leader who
can speak on their behalf

Mercurial or whimsical
responses, possibly changing
temperament at the drop of
a hat.

Leads party to a particular location or acts as a
guide (probably temporarily)

41-50

Is a spy, infiltrator, monster,
shapeshifter, or other type
of being that will eventually
become inimical to the
party. It will likely convey
a primary benefit, but
treachery will be down the
road.

Response – whatever it
might be – is affected by
an enchantment, drugs, or
illusions.

None. Might even be annoying or cause
problematic effects elsewhere in the dungeon.

51-60

Is enchanted as another sort
of being

Response depends entirely
on whether the party has
picked up some item, knows
a password, is wearing
particular garments, or has a
particular appearance (this is
likely a guard of some kind).

Reward for Rescue, or Bounty for Capture

61-70

Is in a very perilous or
precarious situation due
to trap or architecture –
probably trapped in place

Suspicious. Just as suspicious
as the party members are
of him, maybe even to the
point of paranoia.

Will act as diplomat, translator, or interlocutor
on the party’s behalf with a strong monster
who guards access to another location, or
which might give up its treasure to the party

71-80

Looking for someone else,
either for a bounty, rescue,
or something odd (like
delivering a message or
selling life insurance)

Suspicious. Just as suspicious
as the party members are
of him, maybe even to the
point of paranoia.

Will grant wish or confer a magical benefit in
some way

Lost as hell.

Thinks they are someone
else (such as a rescue party

appropriate. Either roll (50%
chance friendly, 50% chance
hostile) or decide in advance
who he will think they are.
Usually this is someone who
is expecting a specific guest.

One or more animal-type or
monster-type creatures that
will follow the party under
certain circumstances (feed
the gelatinous cube and it
falls helplessly in love with
you, for example)

Written Records are covered earlier in this book. See Table 3-18. The useful content of Written Records can also be generated on Table 3-17.

WATER LANDMARKS
Some water landmarks may already have been generated as a transition between areas (if you’re going through these tables
step by step). If this is the case, don’t feel obligated to put in more water landmarks, but if you’ve got waterway transitions, you
certainly have the potential to create a dungeon level that involves quite a bit of water. Which is always cool.

THE “WHAT COMES NEXT” METHOD
Sometimes you just want some creative ideas for what comes next in a dungeon you’re already designing, and you don’t want

to get deep into a whole system for designing a dungeon from the top down. The following table is easier to use when the problem is just a bit of creative block happening mid-stride. It points you back to the above tables, but gives you a specific place to
start instead of just paging around for an idea.

TRICKS

The “Trick” is a very broad concept in adventure design, and I’m not going to try to define it exactly. In general, a trick is

something that requires the players to make meaningful decisions but that isn’t a monster or a trap. Tricks can range all the way
from a sliding corridor to a riddle written on a scrap of parchment.
There are about an infinite number of ways to try and break down the broad concept of a dungeon trick into a series of
tables. After literally years of screwing around with it, I’ve decided to compile my tables into eleven categories: Architectural
Tricks, Bargain and Persuasion Tricks, Experiment Tricks, False Appearance Tricks, Hazard Tricks, Magic Area Tricks, Magic
Thing Tricks, Run-the-Gauntlet Tricks, Substance Tricks, Wager and Game Tricks, and Written Tricks. There is a great deal of
crossover between these categories, too, so don’t approach these tables as if each category is a formula.

profile of a trick, ignoring everything else in this section.

METHOD 1: THE WILD CARD MATRIX
This table is not for the faint of heart – it’s used to generate the overall profile of a trick with absolutely no rhyme or reason,
instead of picking a category and working from there. Roll for each component of the trick (hints, structure, rewards, risks, and
solutions), then put them together in any way that your inspiration takes you.

An actual living

Somehow.
This includes
everything from
a talking animal,
to a person, to a
demon.

It either died
here or is trapped
here, and if the
characters solve
the trick it will be
released

It only gives one clue,
and then taunts. The
taunts may be helpful,
since they only come
when the characters
are doing something
wrong (or when they are
indecisive)

It is a construction
or remnant of
something that
really hates (or
hated) the person
who constructed
the trick.

Progressive hints. The
voice offers an ongoing
commentary to give the
players a status report.
For example, it might
say, “Cold,” “warm,”
or “hot” as characters
get closer to (or farther
from) the solution. If the
players are negotiating
with a personality,
the personality might
get very pissed off at
the talking clue. The
personality and the
talking clue might be
long-time enemies, two
facets of a being with
multiple personalities,
etc.

Makes itself known
to the party, answers
one question, and
then falls silent or
disappears.

Makes itself known to
the party before the trick,
and then answers limited
questions about what
they will be facing. It
does not help once the
trick “begins.”

Speaks once,

itself, delivering a
rhymed couplet, a

Basically, it’s a preprogrammed hint
if the characters
are pursuing a
predictable course
of failure, if they
are inactive, or if
they need to know
that they have now
succeeded.

(d100)

It was simply
designed as a

challenge

Makes compliments as
the players are making
progress, such as, “Well
done.”

Makes a victory
or defeat speech
at the end of the
trick, depending on
whether the party
succeeded.

Eerie or
spooky

It either died
here or is trapped
here, and if the
characters solve
the trick it will be
released

Speaks riddles, poetry
or vague instructions
each time the players
complete some part
of the trick, basically
introducing them to the
next part. Alternatively,
it says something at
the end of each part
to let the players know
something has been
completed.

A threat, challenge,
and/or taunting
before the trick
begins. General
taunting. This will
certainly indicate
that something is
about to happen,
or that there is a
challenge available,
although it might
not convey anything
else except attitude.

Jovial

It was simply
designed as a
built-in part of the
challenge

Makes itself known
to the party, and
then answers limited
questions while they
are trying to solve the
trick. This might include
a game of twenty
questions, or it might
only have a limited set
of answers.

EXPERIMENT TRICKS
In general, an experiment trick is just the combination of things by the characters, and the results. Sometimes these tricks are
obvious (three bottles and mixing basin, or three levers), and sometimes they are not obvious (they combine themselves). It’s best
to decide that after generating the trick, though.
To generate an experiment trick, roll on the Master Table (Table 3-87) to see what two types of elements are being combined,
and what the general type of result is going to be. Roll for specific results on the appropriate columns of the Table of First Elements (Table 3-88) and the Table of Second Elements (Table 3-89). Then juggle those elements around with the “Result Type”
and see what emerges (the Result Types are explained after the tables).

MASTER TABLE OF EXPERIMENT TRICKS
Note: If your experiment turns out to look like something that might have both a good result and a bad result, roll a second
time on the Result Type column to get the alternate possibility. Sometimes, once you’ve generated the experiment and gotten
one result, the other possibility will be very clear.

indirect. For example, a character might get processed into fuel for something else. Or, the charcoal you feed into the statue’s
mouth might be turned into the key for a door. This is a two-step process rather than a one-step process.
Movements or Access: Successfully conducting the experiment opens a door, allows you to get through something, or gives
you something you can use to get through something.
Conditions and Curses: Instead of actually being changed, your condition changes. For example, you might get blessed,
cursed, diseased, cured, healed, electrically charged, able to fly, or crushed. There are many possibilities.
Generation or Genesis: The combination of the trick’s two elements creates something. This might be a useful or harmful
substance, it might be a dimensional gateway, it might be a key or other useful item.

MAGIC AREA TRICKS
Area tricks are those in which an “area” plays a role; the trick affects an area when it “activates,” or else it’s triggered by entering the area (possibly with the additional requirement of taking an action).

• The trick’s actions are described in terms of a combination of four possible elements:
• Correct Action
• Wrong Action
• Beneficial Magical Condition (see Table 3-118)
• Curse (see Table 3-118)
Many area tricks have the area marked off in some way, so they are puzzles rather than just a series of surprises. This is largely up to you, although tables are included to give you ideas for marking areas.

MAGIC THING TRICKS
Interacting with magical things is one of the staples of a dungeon adventure, and it is a broad topic, since neither the word
“magic” nor the word “thing” does much to narrow down the category.
Magic Thing tricks are composed of four basic elements:

• A Warning (possibly): Table 3-96
• A Central Feature: Table 3-97
• A Triggering Action: Table 3-99
• Result of Triggering the Trick: Table 3-100

Die Roll

Warnings (d100)

01-50

None - This sort of trick hits the party by surprise. Sometimes a surprise-trick just means they have to think
fast, but often surprise-tricks are the more dangerous type – in which the party has to cope with magical results
that have already taken effect on them.

51-53

Antigravity or levitation effect in surrounding area, possibly objects are floating in air (as opposed to the central
feature itself)

54-56

Central feature emits heat, cold, or some sort of electricity or lightning (including a static charge)

57-59

Central feature floats in the air

60-62

Central feature is difficult to approach; it might be protected by a force field, be at the top of a long, winding
ramp, or be on an island in a pool of acid, as examples.

63-65

Central feature is in some way decorated far more than one would expect. This might range from as little as a
coat of paint, all the way up to something just dripping with jewels.

Table 3-96: Warnings continued
Die Roll

Warnings (d100)

66-68

Central feature moves in unexpected ways. Any movement at all would be unusual in an inanimate object;
living objects might flicker in and out of existence, teleport from place to place, or just move in ways other than
“normal.”

69-71

Decoys. Far from being made obvious, the trick’s central item has several duplicates to prevent it being spotted
as the main feature (a hall of huge statues, or a pile of shoes, as two quite disparate examples)

72-74

Item emits a strange noise other than speech before its actual “trick” manifests

75-77

Item speaks immediately before its actual “trick” manifests; the players will thus have some warning that they
should be careful about their subsequent actions.

78-80

Lighting effect: the central feature glows, burns, or is wreathed in shadow or darkness

81-83

Protective measures or restraints upon the trick are in plain view. One example is chains binding an apparently
inanimate statue.

84-86

The central feature has some anthropomorphic feature (eyes, a carven face, etc). This might be emphasized
with additional magical features such as glowing eyes – the more anthropomorphic the item already is, the more
likely that there will be “something else” added to those features.

87-89

The item/fixture has surroundings that emphasize its importance; it is surrounded by incense burners, is located
at the end of a long hallway, etc. This can include a marked-off area (see tables above).

90-91

The item/fixture is not highlighted by its surroundings, but the surroundings themselves indicate that something
is unusual: a sense of wrongness, a change in temperature, dimming of torches, etc. The presence of a trick is
clear; the central feature is not immediately obvious

RESULT OF TRIGGERING ACTION
The distinction between a “trick” and a “trap” (at least for the purpose of these

tables) is that a trick can confer a benefit if treated properly. Therefore, if the only
puzzle or matter of player skill involved is to get the trick to activate, the result will be
a benefit. However, many Magic Thing tricks are more complex – triggering them is
only the first step, and the test of player skill begins once the trick is activated.

Emits Warning Signal and then activates some sort of interesting attack, which can be turned off. When the
attack is turned off, the trick gives out a benefit of some kind. The benefit might go only to the person who
turned off the attack, or might be given to everyone. Note that if the “Warning Signal” was hitting the party
with some sort of sucker-punch, the sucker-punch is probably a way of making the party (or certain members)
more vulnerable to the interesting attack. Example of this: when the party triggers the trick, it does two things;
the first is to cast a paralysis spell (which might take down some of the party members) and then open up a
chute full of giant ants. If you’ve got someone who can fight through to the chute and close it, you can cut off
the supply of ants. Instead of paralysis, maybe the trick spat globs of honey before opening the ant-chute.

11-20

Emits Warning Signal and then offers a Choice (see Table 3-110). Each party member (or a random party
member, or certain party members) gets to pick something. Whether or not you get to play might depend on
your response to the warning signal or whether you were involved in triggering the trick in the first place.

21-30

Emits Warning Signal and then offers to answer questions (or otherwise gives out useful information). There
might be a price for answering the questions, and the thing might not mention the price ahead of time.

31-40

Emits Warning Signal and then provides a benefit of some kind. However, if the party doesn’t then provide a
Correct Response (Table 3-102), the benefit will be taken away again, reverse itself into a curse, or otherwise
elicit a bad response.

41-50

Emits Warning Signal and then waits for a Correct Response (Table 3-102). It probably gives a clue of some
sort about what that action is, either by speaking, mental communication, revealing something written, making
a gesture, etc. If the Correct Response is not taken (within some period of time), the Thing confers a curse,
mental disability, a physical disability, or steals stuff (see Table 3-118 and following tables for ideas). If the
Correct Response is made, the thing confers a beneficial magical condition (see Table 3-118 for this, also).

51-60

Emits Warning Signal, and waits a moment. Everyone standing in the right place (however that is determined)
gets a beneficial magical condition (Table 3-118). Everyone standing in the wrong place gets a curse (Table
3-118). In some cases, there might also be neutral areas where the trick does nothing.

61-70

The Thing asks a question and waits for the right answer. Giving the right answer gets you a beneficial magical
condition (3-118). Giving the wrong answer gets you a curse (3-118). In some cases, you might be allowed more
than one wrong answer before getting hit for it. If more than one wrong answer is permitted, There might be
some indication of how many more are left. This might be, for example, a rising water level, a statue holding up
one finger to indicate the wrong answer, a statue putting down one of three fingers to indicate that one of the
three wrong answers has been used, etc. The question might be an interrogation about the party’s intentions,
might be a riddle, or might be about a fact somewhere in the dungeon (“What does the giant statue in the lava
pool look like?”).

71-80

The Thing offers a game, or sets a game in motion (shift over to Game Tricks: see Table 3-108 and following
tables)

81-90

The Thing offers advice. This might be the end of the show, the main benefit of the trick. The advice might
be vague, might be a poem, might be a riddle, etc. On the other hand, it might be crucial whether the party
follows the advice … if the advice is “take a duck,” and there’s a table full of rubber duckies, the party might be
surprised when the giant axe sweeps through the room at neck level (i.e., you were supposed to duck your head).
Often, however, the advice will be about how to get through an architectural trick to a treasure, or what the
name of the demon in room 17 is, or which of the two doors to take.

WARNING SIGNALS

Links of grass

A warning signal is basically a way of alerting the players that the trick’s status has changed. It has woken up, been activated,
gotten annoyed, changed personalities, received a right answer, received a wrong answer, etc.

Abstract Special Effect. The Thing, or something near it, produces energy in the form of an Abstract Special
Effect (see Table 3-98).

Magical speech

11-20

Architectural Change. Something about the surrounding architecture changes. Statues might turn to face
one wall, or to face the characters. A door might appear, a portcullis might rise, etc. Whatever this is, it needs to
be related to the way the trick delivers its “final blow,” whether that’s a benefit, a curse, a disease, or whatever.
As an incredibly simple example: if the result of giving the magic statue the wrong answer to its riddle is going
to be a bunch of fireballs, then one possible architectural change could be the emergence of cannons from the
walls. Feel free to add more subtlety in your own creations, of course.

21-30

Effect on Adventurers. This is a wide category of strange possibilities – it would include: party members
changing position, seeing visions, smelling something, being teleported places (possibly the whole area is
teleported), having sudden flashes of insight, seeing things closer than they are, or having senses of foreboding
(or other emotions).

31-40

Light Effect. Eyes, or some other part of the Thing, light up. Alternatively, something lights up in the
surrounding area. If the area is already lit, then the nature of the lighting changes (color, location, direction,
brightness, etc.).

41-50

Posture Changes. For statues or other representations, this just means moving, shifting, standing, or sitting.
For static things like pillars or pools, it means turning, rising, shifting, sliding, or moving contents around (waves
or ripples form in the pool, for instance). If the thing has a face, changing facial expressions are a possibility.

51-60

Randomize the Remainder of the Trick. Jot down a table in your notes, with 2-6 possible warning
signals (more than 6 is probably going overboard). These warning signals should probably all be variations on
the same type – by which I mean, 6 different poems, 6 different sounds, 6 different sucker-punches, 6 different
possible changes in posture, etc. Make each warning signal correspond to a different reward or threat, a different
question that it asks, a different question that it will answer, etc. When the party reaches this point in the trick,
you will roll on your table to see what the trick does.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Randomizing a trick is a good idea if the party is likely to keep coming back to this
location, or if you use this dungeon over and over again with different players, but it might be overkill if the
party is only ever likely to see the trick do one thing.

61-70

Sounds. The Thing makes a sound of some kind (sings, clanks, screams, etc.). You could generate a sound
randomly on Table 3-71, but it’s usually best to pick something appropriate based on the type of central feature
involved.

71-80

Speaks Poetry. Produces, speaks, or reveals a poem (maybe just a rhyming couplet, if you aren’t feeling
Shakespearian enough to whip up a quick sonnet in iambic pentameter). Everyone has an inner poet. Go for it.

81-90

Speaks Prose. The item says something like, “What do you want?” or “That pissed me off.” There are also
several places on the internet where you can find a Shakespearian insult-generator. I’m just saying.

91-00

Sucker-punch. The trick hits the party or some of the party with a magical curse, mental condition, or
physical harm (including diseases or slow-acting poison). The name of the game from this point on is to get it
to reverse that condition and hopefully get a benefit as well. For tricks like this, there is usually no further bad
consequence that can happen – the worst that can happen is that you’re stuck with the curse, or will die from the
poison, or whatever. Yes, many tricks work this way BEFORE the party does anything wrong. These tricks are
very much like traps.

RUN-THE-GAUNTLET AND FIND-THE-PATH TRICKS
Certain tricks offer a series of risks, but there is a “rule” that can be followed to get through them safely, or at least with minimal damage. The trick is to figure out that rule.
A related but more complex type of gauntlet is the one where there is not a single “rule” for solving it. It is a series of risks in
which each step contains some sort of result – like a game board. In other words, whether it is obvious to the players or not, they
are playing a modified version of Chutes & Ladders, a modified version of Monopoly, a modified version of chess, a modified
version of Candyland, etc. Again, this will not necessarily be obvious, but it certainly can be.

Uses a specific tool
Wheels and gears
Paper lanterns
A blacksmith
Hard reset

The defining characteristic of this type of trick is that there are “safe” and “dangerous” parts of the trick. For a single-rule
pathway, you figure out how to do the whole thing safely, all at once, or else you fail and do it the stupid, obvious, or wrong way.
For a game-board trick, on the other hand, it is largely random whether you land in the safe or dangerous areas – unless you, as
the adventure designer, add some element in which the players can affect their movement through the series.
So, this section offers sets of tables for (1) Single-rule pathways, and (2) Game-board type pathways.

SINGLE-RULE PATHWAYS

slime

One possibility for gauging reaction time is to give the PLAYERS only a limited amount of time to respond (“you have five
minutes to decide”), counting slowly to five before a bad thing happens, or using some other method to limit the amount of
decision-time the players have. Don’t over-use this, though. It is a very high-tension trick, and too much high tension can be as
bad as too much low tension.
The artistry in creating a trick like this is to find a Rule of Passage and a Nature of Risk that work well together. They should
“feel” right in combination.

Jungle gym (doesn’t actually look like a jungle gym,

11-20

Mental test such as riddles. This could include 5050 chances – for example, in Alice in Wonderland,
Alice is confronted with a cake that says “Eat me”
and a bottle that says “Drink me.” She is too big to
get through the mousehole at her present size, but
guessing correctly whether the labels are trustworthy
is one example of this sort of trick: the rule is to
figure out which food/drink increases/decreases size,
the reward is getting through the mousehole, and the
Risk is “Transformation,” as described in the next
column.

Falling rocks and floors. This can also involve statues
tipping onto the characters, walls closing in, etc.

Random Progression. Characters have to pick one
random thing (card, runestone, roll dice, etc) and
face the consequences. Then they are done, and have
gotten through the trick. If the process repeats more
than once, the trick is more in the nature of a Game
Board Pathway (see below).

Monsters. Probably the monsters are themed in some
way to the nature of the gauntlet. They might all be
stone-related, elemental-related, woodland-related,
undead, etc. The monsters might or might not be
“active” at the beginning of the test. Successive failures
of the Rule of Passage might, for example, keep
opening up chutes filled with giant rats.

Figure out which symbol means “safety.”

Rays or bursts of magic with different results. Maybe
there is a floating orb that reacts to movement which
continues more than 4 seconds, for instance, if the
Rule of Passage is to Move Only at the Right Time.

51-60

Take cover behind obstacles (possibly having to
identify which things will give adequate cover and
which won’t). Possibly, the characters would need to
figure out how to activate the “cover.” For example,
putting a shield into the hands of a statue causes the
statue to block the death rays. There might even be a
“trade” of some kind at each place offering potential
cover. Perhaps the statue doesn’t give back the shield,
and the next statue wants money, and the next statue
wants rations, etc.

Transformations. People are turned into something
else, and have to manage to get through the area in
that animal (or other) form. They could also, in some
way, be turned into obstacles that hinder the rest of
the group. If the trick is a chessboard where the only
safe way to move is diagonally, a character who moves
straight might be encased in a block of stone that
blocks off his square. If someone reaches the other
side, the block of stone might disappear and release
the trapped character. Shrinking or growing would be
included here.

61-70

Stand in the right place: certain places are safe and/
or profitable, others are dangerous, unprofitable, or
subject to the “risk” defined in the next column. This
probably follows a pattern. The standard example of
this would be the task of getting across a chessboard
using only the “bishop’s move” of moving diagonally
only.

Falling. In this case, the Rule of Passage is probably
linked to maintaining one’s balance or not having a
support give way beneath them. Bridges over lava pits
blocked by a monster with a big club, green and yellow
disks suspended over space, when the yellow ones are
illusionary and the green ones safe … this sort of thing.

Use your vehicle properly. Vehicles might have
unpredictable controls, odd defenses, strange
capabilities that must be discovered (“We jump when
we hit the red button!”), etc. Vehicles might be very
odd ones, or standard ones like rowing boats or riding
a buffalo.

Teleportation or chutes - or alternatively a form of
imprisonment - that will temporarily separate the
party; probably until they are re-united when the
“survivors” complete the trick. If cages come down to
imprison everyone who doesn’t stand in the right place
at the right time, and the release lever is at the far side
of the room, the party risks having everyone trapped
in cages unless they can figure out when and where to
move in order to avoid being caged.

81-90

Move only at the right time. This would follow
a pattern: move only when the light is green, for
example.

Charm or mental domination. Probably this leads to
the affected characters working against the others,
but this doesn’t necessarily mean direct combat. This
category would also include insanity and belief in a
hallucination or illusion.

91-00

Deactivate the risk. If the risk is coming from a
machine with a red button on it, the solution might
be to shoot an arrow that depresses the button and
turns off the machine. Maybe the risk comes from a
bunch of statues which can be de-animated by pulling
a rope located somewhere. Possibilities are endless.

Loss of equipment or possessions. This can be done
in many ways: as wagers, by rusting metal, by statues
grabbing things away, etc.

GAME BOARD PATHWAYS
The “Mode of Forward Movement” table is highly abstract. At first glance it appears that the players are being moved
through a game board such as Chutes & Ladders, Candyland, or Monopoly. However, a true gameboard is only one possibility
for a “Game Board Pathway” trick. The “squares” can be different rooms, different tiers of a pyramid, different disks, the changing possibility for what’s on the other side of a dimensional door, etc.

The choice or random uncovering of a symbol moves the party to a location matching that symbol. A new
choice of symbols might be presented at each new location. These can be arranged in progressive sets to
make sure the party doesn’t keep moving backward too much. For example, imagine that there are 9 locations,
identified with tiles numbered 1-9. At each location, the party draws a tile to see where they go next. The
starting set of tiles only has the possibility to move to locations 1, 2, and 3. Locations 1, 2, and 3 offer a set of
tiles between 1 and 4. Eventually the party will thus get to location 4. At location 4, the set of available tiles no
longer includes locations 1-3; now the available set of tiles runs from 4-8. In locations 5-8, there is the possibility
of reaching location 9. Thus the pathway is divided into locations 1-3, 4, 5-8, and 9. Symbols can include
anything – runes, playing cards, coins with different denominations, pictorial representations of what is in the
various locations, etc.

In each location along the path, there is particular action the party must take to move forward. Forward
movement might be one “square” at a time; or different actions might allow the party to hop forward more than
one “square,” possibly with stupid actions dropping them backward.

Get the ability to slightly alter the a future move (e.g.,
to add 1 or 2 to a die roll in order to choose one of

that would otherwise be indicated for the next move).

61-70

If the game board operates with a store of “tokens”
that are used, the square might be a place where they
lose some of the tokens. If the game board does not
operate on tokens, this might be a place where they
lose treasure. In this case, the attendant “risk” is that
they cannot proceed without paying what’s effectively
a “toll” to move forward.

Get tokens that can be used to advantage in later
“squares.” Tokens could include rune-stones or other
items that will not be perceived as tokens by the
characters, even though this is how they function, in
an abstract sense, for purposes of designing a game
board style trick.

71-80

One party member must stay behind in this square
until the rest of them complete the game’s sequence.
Why the party member must stay behind can be all
sorts of reasons. The simple “a cage falls on you”
is the brute force possibility. “You must continue
watering the plant until the others can reach a way
to carry it out” is another possibility, illustrating how
wide-ranging this type of risk can be.

One or more party members are transformed into a
stronger form, related to the game’s theme, which will
make them more able to succeed in the game’s future
“squares.” The magic would evaporate at the end of
the game.

81-90

A junction “square” that sends you on a sideline track.
The sideline returns to the main track, and might even
be a shorter path, but the “squares” in the sideline
track are more dangerous than the ones on the main
path.

A shortcut junction. The pathway forks, and returns
to the main path later, but you don’t have to traverse
as many “squares” as you would if you followed the
main pathway.

A trap, particularly a slow trap in which the players
must figure out how to “turn it off.”

Victory. In other words, the way to win the game
board is not only located at the end of the board,
there are ways to win it along the path itself. There

01-10

Choose a challenge. Here, the players have to select a type of challenge, rather than a type of reward. There
is a reward allocated to each challenge, but they don’t know what it will be. This turns the game around a bit,
because the players will try to pick the kind of challenge they can beat most easily rather than focusing on the
reward. Perhaps the reward is the same for each type of challenge (if the choices are something like “combat,”
“puzzle,” and “trial by water”), or the challenges might be ordered in terms of increased difficulty for better
rewards (choose among, “Zar’s easy challenge,” “Zar’s difficult challenge,” and “Zar’s suicidal challenge”).

11-20

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). Some items are good,
some are neutral, and some are dangerous. You only get to choose only once, and you can’t exchange what you
got.

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). Some items are good,

31-40

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). Some items are good,
some are neutral, and some are dangerous. You only get to choose only once, BUT you can exchange what you
got for something else (probably only one exchange is allowed). Of course, you run the risk of getting something
even worse, if you make an exchange. For games of this type, the “worst” item should either be disguised as
something good (so it’s not returned), should end the game, or should be the only non-returnable item.

Structure of the “Choice” Game (d100)

41-50

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). All of the items are useful
to some degree, but some are very useful (magic sword!) and others are pretty disappointing (a pair of socks).
You only get to choose only once, and you can’t exchange what you got.

51-60

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). All of the items – except
one – are useful to some degree, but some are very useful (magic sword!) and others are pretty disappointing
(a pair of socks). You can continue choosing items until someone picks the non-useful item. Then the game
is finished. The non-useful item might just be a token that the game has ended, or it might be cursed (or
poisonous, or fill the room with sleep gas, or teleport the party away from the game room, or whatever).

61-70

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). Some items are good,
some are neutral, and some are dangerous. However, taking an item causes you harm (or puts you at risk of
taking harm). You can choose as many times as you want, if you’re willing to take the risks. Example: six bags of
treasure sitting on a pedestal, surrounded by six glowing balls of light. When you take a bag, the corresponding
ball of light fires a blast at you. If you can take the damage, take all six bags. Here’s a possible twist: the pedestal
is inscribed with a warning that five of the glowing balls shoot minor bolts, but the sixth one shoots a death ray.
Here’s another possible twist: you might not get to grab one bag, then another, then another. You might have to
choose how many bags you’re going to take at one swipe (and you only get the one swipe).

71-80

81-90

91-00

Choose from a group of known categories, such as “coins,” “gems,” “monsters,” “spells,” magical items,” etc.
What you get depends on how the trick is designed. Perhaps it always tells lies, and the categories are deceptively
or incorrectly named. Perhaps the result is determined by rolling on a table. Perhaps only one person can pick
each category. Perhaps it is set up so that one person must choose a dangerous-sounding category. Or perhaps it
is just a way to let players decide if their reward for “winning” a trick is going to be cash or potions. Whatever
works best.
Choose from a group of non-concealed items. The items are symbolic representations (or vague pictures) of
what the real gift is going to be, or alternatively you can see the items but not know what their “powers” are,
so there is guesswork involved in the choice. For example, the choice might be among a little sword (you get a
magic sword), a slightly bigger sword (which turns out to be twelve feet long, non-magical, and impossible to lift),
a dog figurine (you get a temporary ally), a wolf figurine (wolf attacks you) and a bottle (which might turn out
to be wine, a potion, or just an empty bottle). Keep in mind that these could be deceptive. The ominous “skull”
picture might get you a talking skull who knows where lots of treasure is kept.
Choose once, blindly, from a set of options. Each option might be good, bad, or neutral. You can’t trade them
in or get a second try, but each option comes with a little clue. The clue, if it is interpreted properly, will let you
improve the thing you chose in some way. A cursed item might be neutralized, a neutral item become valuable,
and a good item become better (or last longer, or affect more people, etc). But to get that benefit you have to
answer the riddle on the container, or find where “the fire meets the eagle” somewhere in the dungeon, or some
other type of challenge or task.

Game Series (d100)
Make a list of six or ten beneficial magical conditions (Table 3-118) and curses (also Table 3-118) in a proportion
of 60-40 benefits to backfires. Each time the trick is used, roll a die to determine the effect. The effects are
“used up” once they are rolled, and if the same number is re-rolled, the result is “no effect.” A character can
only try the trick one time. A second attempt to use the trick results in a curse from Table 3-118. It is up to the
referee to determine whether the curses are minor compared to the benefits, if they are about the same scale, or
if the curses are significant and the benefits considerable.

It was a terrible
idea, I admit.

41-50

As above, but instead of rolling a single die (a linear probability curve) the referee rolls 3d6 or some other
combination of dice and adds the results together. Thus, certain results are more probable than others.

51-60

Unlike the above, the game series is based on a series of die rolls, following the rules of craps (possibly disguised
in some way by an innovative referee).

61-70

Unlike the above, the game series is like a slot machine. The referee (or even the player, depending on the trick)
rolls 3d6. Each number corresponds to a picture (either little cherries or lemons like in a slot machine, or tarot
card pictures for something more sinister). Combinations of various numbers (three threes, for example) have
a certain payoff. For a game series like this, each character should only be allowed to play once, unless it costs
something to play.

Die Roll

71-80

Heart of the
manticore

Game Series (d100)
Unlike the above, the game series might be a die roll “race,” possibly represented by little figures on a track.
The character might pull a lever and the referee rolls a die to see how far the character’s “man” moves. Then
the referee rolls for the other side. If the character gets his man to the finish line first, he gets a benefit. There
might be a backfire if he loses. Think of various carnival games for ideas on how this might look.

Chickens
Dream trees
Deadly nightshade
Dreams from the
cemetery

81-90

The character is allowed to attempt a task similar to some sort of carnival game (other than a straight-up race,
as described above). This might be a to-hit roll in an attempt to throw a ring over a prize, just like a ring toss.
The player might have choices over what to aim for, with the more desirable prizes being harder to gain. Failure
might incur a backfire – if not, there should be some cost to play, or each character should be limited to only
one attempt.

The game series might be some other sort of game, such as a card game, played in real life between the referee
and the player. These should be extremely short (rock, paper, scissors, for example), or they will bore other
players very quickly.

BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF READING THE WRITTEN TRICK
Written tricks with a purely negative effect are basically traps. In general, if the trick is hard to read, don’t also make it
misinformation. The one exception to this rule is when one set of writing is truthful (say, the guy with the bad handwriting) and
one is false (the guy with the good handwriting is a liar). In this case, once the party has figured this out, knowing which set of
information should be helpful down the road: they can get major clues when they find future notes written in bad handwriting.
A random mix of truth and lies, with no way to judge which is which, can be frustrating rather than fun. And then, of course,
there are exceptions to every rule!

Table 3-116: Beneficial Effect of Reading the Written Trick
Die Roll
01-20

Deliberately reading the picture/characters/words causes a magical benefit to the reader (see Table 3-121 for
ideas)

21-40

Simply viewing the picture/characters/words causes a magical benefit to the reader (see Table 3-121 for ideas)

41-60

The picture/characters/words convey helpful information in the form of a map (10%) or other information (roll
on Table 3-17 Information Content for Rumors).

61-80

The trick is to decipher or be able to view or interpret the message contained in a form of Unusual Writing (see
Table 3-117 below).

81-00

The written trick gives instructions that must be immediately followed; following the instructions gains a magical
benefit from Table 3-121 (or, possibly, allows survival of something nasty that suddenly happens) – ignoring the
instructions causes a curse (see Table 3-118 for ideas) or a trap result. For example, if you read “jump to the
left” on a sign, it might be a good idea to jump to the left. On the other hand, perhaps it’s actually a trap and
there’s a pit to the left. Life is unfair.

TRAPS, GENERALLY

Dream of a Dead
Man

Traps are divided into basic traps, which usually offer a
single type of risk, and complex traps, which involve more
than just the “trigger + result” profile of a basic trap. Basic
mechanical traps, without any sort of complicated trigger,
are the classic “hallway traps.” When they are concealed in
items or have complicated triggers, basic mechanical traps
are the staple form of a “room trap.” Rigged natural features
(a basic trap), and all complex traps, are more unusual – but
they can be some of the most memorable parts of a dungeon
level as long as they aren’t overused. Too many traps can spoil
a dungeon adventure by slowing the characters (and the pace

of the adventure) down to a slow and boring crawl.

Trap Concealment (d100)

Complicated Trigger (d100)

Alcove

A chemical requires a certain level of coolness to remain inactive. Nearby
flames (such as torches) cause it to react and activate the trap

Altar

A chemical requires a certain level of heat to remain inactive. Shadows
cause it to react and activate the trap

Aquarium

A coating of grease covers a substance that heats up when exposed to air;
if the grease is smeared, the heat of the chemical reaction activates the
trap

Flashes of light

Barrel or cask

A feather is suspended over a very delicate pressure plate. If it is blown
down by air currents, it will activate the trap when it lands (so would other
very light objects)

Shadow bird

Bath or basin

A glass globe (possibly quite small) contains a chemical that is highly
reactive when exposed to air. If the globe breaks (and is still in the right
place) the heat of the chemical reaction activates the trap

Bed

A hanging object or an object resting on the floor holds down a vertical
tripwire. If the object is removed, the tripwire flies into the ceiling
(probably due to a counterweight) and the trap is activated

Book

A highly reactive powder is located upon a heat sensor of some kind.
Body heat, oils in skin, or exhaled carbon dioxide concentrations (three
different triggers, here) cause the powder to react and activate the heat
sensor or burn through a thread

Carpet or rug

Beam of light (possibly invisible, possibly not, possibly visible only with
unusual type of vision) has a “photoreceptor.” Something blocks the beam
of light, but if that item is moved, the light will hit the photoreceptor and
activate the trap

Effect of Lethal Poison (d100)

51-52

Experience Point Erosion (lethal): failed saving throw means that character loses a particular number of
experience points every hour until reaching 0 (death). The more lethal the poison, the higher the number of
experience points lost each hour. Experience points return (at some rate) if the poison is neutralized.

53-54

Internal damage (ability score based): if the victim fails a saving throw, he suffers internal damage and must
make a “check” against his constitution score every time he suffers damage from another source. Failing the
check (rolling higher than the ability score on a d20) indicates that the damage caused by the poison causes
death (from a weakened artery, stomach lining, etc).

55-56

Internal damage (increasing): if the victim fails a saving throw, he suffers internal damage and has a 10% chance
of dying when he next takes damage from a wound, spell, fall, or other source of hit point damage. The next
wound has a 15% chance of killing him, the next wound a 20% chance, and so on. (A stronger poison might
have a higher initial chance of death or cumulate at more than 5% per wounding).

57-58

Internal damage (lethal): if the victim fails a saving throw, he suffers internal damage and has a 10% chance of
dying each time he takes damage from a wound, spell, fall, or other source of hit point damage. (A stronger
poison might have a higher chance of death).

59-60

61-62

Internal damage (saving throw/level based - progressive): if the victim fails a saving throw, he suffers internal
damage and must make a saving throw every time he suffers damage from another source. Failing the saving
throw indicates that the damage caused by the poison causes death (from a weakened artery, stomach lining,
etc). Each saving throw has a cumulative –1 penalty.
Internal damage (saving throw/level based): if the victim fails a saving throw, he suffers internal damage and
must make a saving throw every time he suffers damage from another source. Failing the saving throw indicates

Lethal (don’t sleep): failed saving throw means the character has a 25% chance of dying whenever he sleeps
unless the poison is reversed.

69-70

Lethal (don’t sleep): failed saving throw means the character will succumb to the poison and die when he next
sleeps.

71-72

Lethal (stay out of the sun): failed saving throw means the character takes damage from sunlight (some number
of points per hour’s exposure) and those hit points cannot be healed unless the poison itself is removed from the
system.

73-74

Lethal, delayed by level: failed saving throw means that the character will die in a number of combat rounds
equal to his level.

Lethal, delayed by level: failed saving throw means that the character will die in a number of hours equal to his
level.

Level Erosion (lethal): failed saving throw means that the character loses a level and continues to lose more levels
(perhaps one per day) until reaching 0 (death). Level loss is permanent unless the levels are restored. Note:
levels tend to be associated with life force, so this sort of poison would likely be associated with the undead,
planes of shadow, or other such supernatural forces. Mere loss of memory would be better addressed with a
poison that erodes experience points rather than experience levels

91-92

Level Erosion (lethal): failed saving throw means that the character loses a level and continues to lose more levels
(perhaps one per day) until reaching 0 (death). Levels are regained (at some rate) if the poison is neutralized.

93-94

Percentile chance of death (eroding): Each hour, the victim has a percentage chance of dying instantly (the
percentile chance corresponding to the strength of the poison). The percentile chance increases each hour.
Example: if the victim fails a saving throw, he has a 10% chance of dying immediately; if he survives, he must
make a check every subsequent hour, with the first check at 15%, the second check at 20%, etc.

95-96

Percentile chance of death: Each hour, the victim has a percentage chance of dying instantly (the percentile
chance corresponding to the strength of the poison).

97-98

Saving throw checks (eroding): a failed saving throw means the character starts the process of dying, but can
stave it off for a while – each hour, the character must make a saving throw or die instantly. Also, each hour, a
cumulative –1 penalty is added to that die roll.

99-00

Saving throw checks: a failed saving throw means the character starts the process of dying, but can stave it off for
a while – each hour, the character must make a saving throw or die instantly.

POISON EFFECTS (NON-LETHAL)
Note that “mental” effects of poisons are short term – that would indicate insanity, which is much more linked with magic
than poisons are – a “poison” is something that works non-magically. Magical poisons should be thought of as potions, and

poison would indicate a poison of quasi-mythical potency and will understandably tick off your players).

BASIC TRAPS (RIGGED NATURAL FEATURES)
The above trap tables are great for generating a huge variety of mechanical traps, but sometimes a trap is constructed by
taking advantage of an already existing, inherently dangerous feature of the terrain – and making it more dangerous for people
who don’t know the right way to handle it. For traps like these, roll on the following table (which is a repeat of one of the trick
tables, but used differently):

BASIC TRAPS (MAGICAL)
Magical traps are those with a non-mechanical effect or a non-mechanical trigger. In addition to the trap’s actual effect, there
will often be some sort of special effect that goes with it (See Table 3-136).

• The Draw: This first stage might or might not be present; it is a mechanism that brings the party into the area
where the trap can take effect and/or triggers the trap.
• The Prison: The second stage is virtually always present; an element that holds the characters in place or in a
particular location.
• The Kill Mechanism: The third stage is an element that kills them slowly in that location.

A cloak of feathers
Moonbeams
The value of the

• The Kill-switch: The fourth element, which is virtually always present in a slow-kill trap, is a kill switch or mechanism of escape.

Party is swallowed by something

monsters (or even invulnerable
ones) that don’t attack (probably
constructs, elementals, or
undead) move to guard the exit.
They might respond if pushed;
this isn’t as unfair as it sounds –
remember, they are serving as
a wall, and walls are essentially
invulnerable, too.

Powerful monsters emerge and push the
party members into cells (or something
equivalent), then leave. It’s possible but
highly unlikely the party can beat them,
but the monsters don’t actually attack,
either. Undead or constructed monsters
work best for this. The other possibility
is a virtually unbeatable horde of lesser
monsters that also don’t actually attack,
just put the party into the cells.

Series of flat percentile chances to die

such as drop in ability score, hit points,

death.

Objects are pushed into room one
at a time. Eventually there won’t
be more room, and anyone inside
will be crushed as more objects are
forced in.

Dangerous liquids (boiling
water, slime, etc) squirt or

area at random intervals.

81-90

A series of “steps,” each associated
with a greater level of inability to act

KILL-SWITCHES AND ESCAPE HATCHES
A kill-switch is a way of turning off a trap, either before it springs or once it is already in operation. In slow-killing traps, it
can be a matter of life or death to figure out how the kill-switch operates (or where it is). Escape hatches usually have to be figured out or found as well, but instead of turning off the trap, they allow people to exit before being killed or harmed.

Magically-Induced Weakness (d100)

A chronic
condition

Acid Damage Magical acid is involved with the trap as a secondary feature or complication. If the victim
fails some sort of check (morale, saving throw, percentile chance, etc.) he may be subject to such things as (1)
becoming unable to act due to pain, (2) becoming temporarily blind, (3) having his equipment damaged, or (4)
taking normal damage.

Capture them!

03-04

Adhesiveness and Friction. Magical adhesiveness or slipperiness is involved with the trap as a secondary
feature.

Find the line

05-06

Affect Ground or Rock. Rock might be turning to mud (or changing back), or some other magical effect is
working upon the stone in the area while the characters try to escape.

07-08

Affect Metal. Magical properties of the trap are affecting metal while the characters try to escape. This could
include causing the metal to animate, affecting it as a magnet, making it rust, heating it up, chilling it to deadly
low temperatures, causing it to conduct electricity, shaping it at will, making it brittle, changing its physical
properties, causing it to constrict, or some combination thereof.

09-10

Affect Wood. The trap can animate wooden items, causing them to attack the party.

11-12

Affect Wood. The trap’s properties, magical or alchemical) affect wood in such a way as to make it brittle or
bend it. If the means of escaping the trap involve something made of wood, this might create a serious race
against time.

01-02

13-14

Affects the Use of Limbs. Whether it is because of extreme cold, a spell, or some other magical means, it
is difficult to use one’s limbs while trapped, and it becomes more difficult as time passes. This could be due to
anything from a clumsiness curse, to confusion, to intense cold, to twitching movements.

15-16

Animate Objects. The trap includes some objects that animate and attack the party.

17-18

Asphyxiation. The magical part of the trap removes or reduces the target’s ability to breathe. Death is
not immediate, and the period of time required for the victim to die can be measured out in several ways (see
Table 3-143 (Measuring out Life) or Table 3-128 (Effects of Gas). Don’t worry if the character seems to be able
to hold his breath for an incredibly long time – just assume that he manages to catch a gasp of air somehow
during the process.

19-20

Aversion. The magical part of the trap tries to create an aversion to something that is in the trap with the
characters. If they “catch” the aversion, it will make it more difficult to handle the rest of the trap.

21-22

Body Infestation. The trap infests the victim’s body with a plant or animal growth

Altered methods

23-24

Burial. If it is not already a feature of the trap, the trap keeps trying to bury the characters in some substance
as they try to escape.

25-26

Clumsiness. If affected, the characters in the trap suffer one or more of the following effects: a penalty to hit,
a penalty to armor class, inability or reduction in spell casting, and/or the chance to drop any items they are
holding. Actual dexterity score is not necessarily affected. The way in which the trap causes clumsiness could
include overloading one of the victim’s emotions (joy, rage, hate, greed, fear); an alchemical reaction (mysterious
chemicals in the waters of the trap); the effects of tiny but continual electrical shocks; or a very weak poison,
curse, or disease.

27-28

Cold Damage. Increasing cold causes progressive damage (or it becomes progressively harder to avoid
damage).

29-30

Compelling Sound. The trap includes a sound-causing feature that tries to magically compel the characters
to do something, or stop doing something. The longer they are exposed, the more difficult it becomes to avoid
the compulsion.

31-32

Constitution Loss. The trap slowly drains constitution from the victims while they are trying to escape. The
effect is probably temporary, but if constitution is the key to surviving the other features of the trap, this could
be a nasty “kicker” to the trap’s overall lethality.

33-34

Dehydrate, Desiccate, Suck Fluids. Some magical feature of the trap sucks blood or dehydrates the victim
(possibly all the way into powder).

35-36

Despondency. The trap causes intense despondency or lethargy, which may keep the characters from even
attempting to escape if they are affected or exposed long enough.

37-38

Dexterity Loss. The trap slowly drains dexterity from the victims while they are trying to escape. The effect
is probably temporary, but if quick hands or graceful movement is the key to surviving the other features of the
trap, this could be a nasty “kicker” to the trap’s overall lethality.

39-40

Dimensional Features. This type of magical trap feature taps other dimensions of time and space to screw
around with the movement or other abilities of the trapped characters.

41-42

Disease. The trap causes a fast-acting disease that gets progressively worse while in the trap.

43-44

Distracting Sound. The trap includes a sound-causing feature that is really distracting, causing problems for
the characters as they try to escape, fight, etc.

45-46

Electrical Damage. The trap causes progressive electrical damage to the target, or small repeated
electrical attacks. There may also be an additional result involved after a certain point, or if a saving throw
fails – possibilities include: random actions for some number of rounds, loss of bodily coordination, mental
disorientation, temporary paralysis, etc.

47-48

Fear. The trap causes magical fear, paralyzing or keeping the affected character from acting (to some degree).

49-50

Fire. The trap includes a magical fire feature – if the victim fails some sort of check (morale, saving throw,
percentile chance, etc.) he reflexively takes some action in response to the fire. These could include: panic for a
couple of combat rounds, trying to put out the fire, or writhing in pain. It might be that the “check” becomes
more difficult as time passes.

51-52

Hallucinations or Illusions. The trap includes magically or drug-induced hallucinations.

53-54

Ice. Magical ice plays a role in the trap, either immobilizing, causing damage, or being slippery.

55-56

Immobilization. Magical immobilization might include dancing, twitching, laughing, vomiting, nausea,
confusion, jumping, floating, talking, scratching, begging for mercy, thinking, arguing, holding one’s breath,
hiding, and meditating.

57-58

Implant Eggs or Larva. While everything else is going on, the trap is trying to inject eggs or larva into the
characters, which will distract them from other parts of the trap.

59-60

Insanity. The trap includes a progressive risk of magically induced insanity.

61-62

Intelligence Loss. The trap slowly drains intellect from the victims while they are trying to escape. The effect
is probably temporary, but if intelligence is the key to surviving the other features of the trap, this could be a
nasty “kicker” to the trap’s overall lethality.

63-64

Light, Dark, and Shadow. The trap involves magical light, dark, or shadow to cause a threat to the trapped
characters, or to make it more difficult to escape.

65-66

Luck. The characters in the trap become progressively more unlucky (probably a temporary effect, but a trap
is not the place where you want to suddenly become unlucky).

67-68

Magic Drain (spells). The trap progressively drains away spell power.

69-70

Magic Force. Some sort of magical force pushes or pulls the characters while they are trying to deal with the
rest of the trap.

71-72

Magical Vortex. Mist, smoke, steam, vapor, fog, or some other kind of gas moves in a powerful whirlwind
or series of gusts. The substance might be poisonous, might be choking, might be hot, might be cold, might
conduct electricity, might dispel magic, or could have any number of other properties. It might not necessarily
fill the entire area where the characters are trapped, but would probably move around in that case.

83-84

Progressively Damaging Sound. The trap includes a sound-causing feature that causes a low but
increasing level of damage.

85-86

Rage. The trap causes rage, either in a series of steps or determined when a saving throw fails. Characters
affected by the rage will probably not be much help in escaping the situation.

87-88

Size and Density. The size or density of the characters is being slowly changed while they are in the trap.

89-90

Sleep or Catatonia. The trap presents an increasing risk of magical sleep or catatonia.

97-98

Telekinesis and Teleportation. Items are flying or teleporting around the area, or some other teleportation
or telekinetic effect is used to cause problems.

99-00

Transformation. While the characters are in the trap they are also slowly being changed into something else.

increasingly negative effects) until it becomes cost-effective to pay for the curing (or the party’s cleric gains enough levels to cast
the spell).

“Beneficial” Effect (d100)

Progressive Deteriorations (d100)

Insight; the hallucinogen functions as a lowpowered detection spell against specific hazard
such as traps, or toward a specific benefit (sensing
the presence of gold, for example)

Double-loss of the “beneficial effect.” Whatever benefit
the character gains while under the drug’s influence is
reduced below normal while the character is not under
the influence. The amount of the negative effect probably
increases over time, starting out as very minor or not even
present. That “not even present” possibility could make a
character repeatedly drink from a supply of “potions” that
are actually an addictive hallucinogen.

Attribute Gain: while the character is under the
influence of the drug, some attribute score is
increased to the point where it creates a bonus or
other benefit

Hit point gain: while the character is under the
influence of the drug, he or she is capable of
taking more damage than normal.

Increasing episodes of confusion, possibly to the point
where a spell caster cannot always succeed at casting a
spell, or a fighter cannot reliably make attacks in any
particular combat round.

76-00

Berserk attacks or a “danger sense” that gives the
character some sort of benefit in combat – some
of these might also have a negative effect: berserk
attacking usually makes the character easier to
hit as well as being able to hit more effectively.

Deteriorating senses: character is becoming less able to see
things clearly, for example, starting the process of getting
penalties to attack rolls, etc.

SARCOPHAGI AND THEIR CONTENTS

The Five of Swords

A few points about sarcophagi as they are used in dungeon-adventure design. There are some rooms in which opening
sarcophagi is like opening a box of chocolates – you never know what you’re going to get. In rooms like this, most or all of the
sarcophagi will be identical, or there might be “types” that can be identified by some hint in the decorations. The ones with red
stone patterns might contain ghouls, while the ones with blue stone patterns might contain treasure. A second type of sarcophagus room contains a couple of highly distinctive ones – there might be some of the “box of chocolate” ones, but the central
feature is the one or two very unusual ones.

GEMS AND PRECIOUS STONES
There are considerably more precious stones and gems in the world than the ones listed here, but the unfamiliarity (and scientific sound) of the rarer types don’t tend to give the same satisfying feeling as a black pearl…

(d100)

Notes (Do not roll dice)

01-02

Agate

A form of chalcedony. When cut, agates often show beautiful banding and stripes; these
are called striped agate. Agate can also be the mineral which forms a fossil.

03-04

Agate Geode

Rock nodules containing agate inside. These can be dramatic when cut open, but since
they make a bowl shape when cut, and have unremarkable rock on the outside, they
would not ordinarily be used as personal jewelry.

Die Roll

05-06

Fossilized tree resin. Amber can come in many colors, usually with a yellowish cast.
Blue amber exists, and is the rarest form. Amber occasionally contains insects that were
trapped in the resin and fossilized along with it.

Amethyst (Purple)

A variety of quartz. It can be carved, and since it was believed by the Romans to
prevent drunkenness, they carved it into cups.

09-10

Amethyst (Yellow)

A yellow form of amethyst.

11-12

Apatite

Green and blue colored apatite are used as gemstones. The stone can occasionally be
chatoyant (i.e., a cat’s-eye appearance).

13-14

Aquamarine

A blue form of beryl.

15-16

Beryl

Pure beryl is transparent; when it contains impurities, these give it color. Colored forms
of beryl have other names – emeralds and aquamarine are both forms of beryl.

17-18

Bloodstone

A dark green chalcedony flecked with spots of red jasper. It is also often called
Heliotrope.

Highly artistic

27-28

Diamond

Most diamonds are clear, but impurities can result in diamonds of almost any color –
these are rarer than clear diamonds.

29-30

Diamond (Black)

Black diamonds don’t exist in the real world, so they are fabulously rare in fantasy
worlds

31-32

Diamond (Blue)

Blue diamonds. These result from boron impurities, but the important thing is that they
are rarer (more valuable) than normal diamonds.

Cloves

33-34

Emerald

The green form of beryl. Emeralds are rare and valuable.

The peril of a

35-36

Feldspar

A very common mineral, but some forms of it are lustrous and attractive. Moonstone is
a form of feldspar, and virtually all valuable feldspar would be a form of moonstone.

37-38

Garnet

A fairly common mineral, but some forms of it are rarer and interesting. Some forms of
garnet change color depending on the light; for example, one type changes from a bluegreen all the way to purple. Garnets come in a variety of colors; red, yellow, brown, etc.
There is a blue type, which is the rarest.

39-40

Golden Beryl

A golden yellow form of beryl, often called Heliodore.

A long-sought

41-42

Hematite

Hematite is a metal, a form of iron oxide, which varies from steel-colored to black,
to red. Powdered hematite dust can be fatal if inhaled, and was used as a trap in an
ancient Egyptian tomb.

Jade (Green)

The most valuable form of jade (with the exception of black jade, which doesn’t exist in
the real world).

51-52

Jasper

Opaque chalcedony that has been polished. Colors range around red, yellow, brown
and green, but there is also a rarer blue type.

A strange noise

53-54

Lapis Lazuli

A blue, relatively rare semi-precious stone. A lot of lapis was used in the jewelry found
in Tutankhamen’s tomb.

Peasant Rebellion

55-56

Malachite

A vibrant green, relatively common stone.

Deceptive
appearance

57-58

Moonstone

A form of feldspar which looks pearl-like and reflects light, vaguely, from inside the
stone.

59-60

Moss Agate

Agate that contains filament-like patterns of other minerals. These look like plant
material, giving the stone the “moss” name.

61-62

Mother of Pearl

Pearl-like deposits, very common. The value of a piece of mother-of-pearl would
depend almost entirely upon the quality with which it was carved, not the value of the
mother-of-pearl itself. However, a really big piece would have to have come from a giant
clam or oyster (rarer), and weirdly shaped fantasy mollusks could also create weirdlyshaped pieces of mother-of-pearl, and these would also be relatively rare.

63-64

Obsidian

Volcanic glass. Obsidian is dark colored, and can be used to make very sharp edges.

65-66

Onyx

A form of banded quartz.

67-68

Opal

Opal ranges widely in color, although the red and black ones are rare. Opals have lots
of internal colors all together, which is very unusual.

69-70

Opal (Black)

Black opals are the rarest kind of opal. They still have other colors within the stone, the
rarest combination being black and red.

71-72

Opal (Fire)

Fire opal would be the reverse of a black opal, predominantly red with internal black
colorations.

73-74

Pearl

Formed in oysters. They can have a wide range of rarity based on color and shape.
Sea pearls are also rarer than freshwater ones. Mollusks other than oysters can produce
pearls, and some of these can be quite valuable.

75-76

Pearl (Black)

Black pearls are very rare; they do exist in the real world.

77-78

Pearl (Purple)

A rare color of sea pearl

79-80

Ruby, emerald, sapphire, and diamond are the four true precious stones. Rubies are the
same mineral as sapphires, but they are the ones running from pink to dark red.

87-88

Sapphire

One of the four true precious stones, sapphires are a form of corundum which can be
any color other than pink or red (which are considered rubies).

89-90

Sapphire (White)

There is no such thing as a white sapphire, so these would be much more valuable than
ordinary sapphires, which are already quite valuable.

91-92

Tiger’s Eye

A form of quartz that is “chatoyant,” meaning that it looks like there is an eye.

93-94

Topaz (any)

Pure topaz is colorless

95-96

Topaz (blue)

Blue topaz is the rarest color of topaz

97-98

Tourmaline

A semi-precious stone that can be found in almost any color, including colorless.

Turquoise (various
colors)

Lower-quality turquoise is fairly common, but higher quality specimens can be very
valuable indeed. Egypt and Persia were the first major sources of turquoise. The stone
can be blue, green or red, and often has veins of color running through it.

INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER FOUR
The previous three chapters contain tables designed to spark ideas: the first chapter addresses missions and villainous plans,
the second chapter focuses on monsters, and the third chapter focuses on constructing a dungeon adventure. This fourth chapter
provides tables for non-dungeon adventures – castles, ruins, forests, other dimensions, and others.

PATTERN OF NON-DUNGEON ADVENTURES
The patterns listed here also apply to dungeon adventures, but when designing wilderness or other types of adventures it is
often more important than with dungeon adventures to step back and look at the overall structure of what you’re putting together. The reason is that in a dungeon, so many possibilities are hardwired into the map: you can’t go up or down unless the map
allows it, your visibility is limited, and there are only a limited number of pathways. In a wilderness or non-dungeon adventure,
you have to give some thought to the broader possibilities (both the advantages and disadvantages) involved.

ADVENTURE PATTERNS
• Physical reconnaissance followed by an assault
• Physical reconnaissance followed by infiltration (with combat likely)
• Diplomatic reconnaissance followed by assault
• Diplomatic reconnaissance followed by infiltration (with combat likely)
• Set-piece event with direct combat, or with diplomatic or physical reconnaissance followed by combat. Note: in
general, the whole reason behind starting with a set-piece event is to create a viciously fast-moving race against time.
• Exploration (physical reconnaissance) involving multiple encounters (assault, diplomacy, etc)

AERIAL ADVENTURES
Most aerial adventures contain non-aerial elements, such as a cloud castle
or a cliff-side, although this isn’t necessarily always the case. What’s meant
by an “aerial adventure” here is that the adventure contains significant elements
involving flying or falling. These might include travel-type adventures where much
of the adventure is a dangerous flying journey to another location, or adventures
where flying is a major tactical element involved in the way the characters must
handle a non-aerial feature. An example of the latter might be a tall cliffside with many

Traps react to

entrances that have no stairways between them, or, even if the cliff has stairways, there are
flying enemies that must be fought off while getting from one place to another on the cliff.

EVENTS IN THE AIR
Note: this is not an encounter table – it is for use in designing significant components of an adventure. An encounter table
would need to have higher likelihood of “normal” events such as a flock of birds, and lower chances of encountering the weird
events such as floating rocks.

CASTLES AND RUINS
Castles and ruins will generally be used quite differently from each other in adventures, since castles are occupied (political or
assault-on-occupied-location types of adventures) and ruins are mainly abandoned (explore-and-loot types of adventures). However, for purposes of getting ideas, castles and ruins are very similar. Both involve open-air adventuring with a possible aerial
component, and the background and physical design of the adventure locale is a very similar process – since ruins are usually the
broken and abandoned form of a castle-like settlement.

PEOPLE IN A CASTLE

Wizard’s research

The list below is useful because it gives a picture of the castle as a self-contained community, which (as fortresses) they tend to
be. Even if your campaign isn’t based on the medieval period, and your “castle” is actually a Pagoda or a clay-brick hill fortress
in a Mesopotamian-type region, these same jobs are likely to exist, just with different names.

Marshall

In charge of the wagons, horses, grooms, and all transportation.
Carters and a head groom report to this officer.

Lord

Although the actual “ownership” of a castle can vary (emperors and
kings have several castles they own directly), some noble will reside
in most castles either as a vassal or as the direct owner.

Porter

Responsible for keeping track of who enters and leaves the
fortification, and for granting access. Usually stationed in the
gatehouse, although not normally part of the actual guard. This
is the person you have to convince, if you’re trying to sneak in
disguised as a group of merchants.

CITIES AND SETTLEMENTS
PREPARING FOR A CITY ADVENTURE:
City adventures are perhaps the most complicated type of adventure to create, since there is so much activity going on around
the characters at all times. Before trying to design a city adventure, it’s a good idea to stop and think about why the characters
are in the city, and what level of detail you’re going to need to handle that sort of adventure. If the adventure is a mere shopping
trip, you will bog everything down if you try to make the players listen to the details of every shop and residence they see, street
by street, with descriptions of the people passing by … when all they want is to replace a broken longsword and get back to
adventuring.
If this is the first time you have used this city (i.e., it’s not a feature that has recurred several times in your campaign already),
then it’s important to brand something memorable about the city onto the players’ minds. This “capsule” detail about the city
should cover two things: a visual image of the city; and one simple detail about how the city is risky or gives a significant benefit
to the characters themselves, on a personal level. Players do not remember details – they think about things in terms of one or two
major features. Rather than inundating them with details to filter, go ahead and smack them with what’s really memorable right
at the beginning. Ideas for the sorts of quirky things that can make a city memorable are listed in Tables 4-18 to 4-22. As a general rule, a city should almost be a caricature of itself – focus really, really hard on the city’s central characteristic, at least until
the players have it drilled into their heads. Once they “know” the city, of course, you can introduce more details, but still: always

An attribute of a
virus
Use the dice
Unused words
Emerald casket
A contraption of
some kind
It keeps careful
count
Giant statue
Beyond all
expectations

slowly enough for the players to remember!

THE THREE TYPES OF CITY ADVENTURES
There aren’t sharp distinctions between the three types of adventures listed here – many city adventures are in the gray areas
between these categories. As things get more complicated – which happens because you offer a “hook” to something more complex, or because the players decide to interfere more and more in the city’s business – the adventure will tend to slide closer and
closer down the scale toward the exploration type (see below).
Shopping Trips. Shopping trip type adventures aren’t really adventures at all, or, at least, not at the beginning. The players
begin this sort of adventure when they want to buy equipment, get healing, find information, or undertake some other mundane,
non-adventuring type of activity. Most of the time, you should almost hand-wave this sort of trip into a city. If the players aren’t
trying to gather information or do anything other than buy things, then you’re only getting in the way if you try to turn it into
an adventure. For this sort of visit to a city, it’s usually enough to give the players the “capsule information” about the city, and
perhaps a sketch map of the major streets with the important shops and temples marked.
Mission Adventures. Sometimes, however, the characters are venturing into the city with a mission. Missions normally
have two phases: an information-gathering phase and a combat phase. In the information-gathering phase, tactical information
is far less important than knowing which people have the important information and how the party might track it down. On the
other hand, when the mission turns into combat, you will usually need to have a very small-scale tactical map of where the
combat will take place. When creating such a map, take advantage of the features that are unique and special to city adventures:
balconies, multi-story buildings, rooftops, the possibility of using the open sky above, and bystanders. Depending on the adventure and where it might lead, it’s possible that you’ll need more than one such map, representing two alternative places where a
fight might break out, or for two places in a “series,” in which the second location is a place the characters will only reach if they
are “succeeding” in the adventure. For a mission adventure, you will need not only the low-detail city map used in a shopping
trip, but also these little pinpoint locations. Mission adventures can include any of the following: looking for work, performing
that work (usually a mission), pursuing a manhunt into the city, and making contact with dangerous people (a thieves guild or
assassins guild for example). Tables 1-3 through 1-9 can be very useful if the characters are looking for work.
Exploration Adventures. In this sort of adventure, the players decide to wander randomly through the city to see what
they find. It is almost impossible to plan for an adventure of this type. To prepare for an exploration adventure, it is usually best
to avoid creating pre-planned maps of anything, and to rely on random generation tables for most of the events. Running this
type of adventure requires so much creative mental activity on your part that a random generation tool is often the only way
to keep things moving at a brisk pace. Another tool for running this sort of adventure is to sketch out one or two little location-maps, just as one would for a mission adventure, but to keep them in reserve for use wherever and whenever combat actually takes place (these are often called “geomorphs”). The tables in this book can be very useful for generating the walk-through of
a city map.
Because these three types of city adventures tend to mix and blend in with each other, the tables in this section aren’t organized as a step-by-step procedure. As you design your adventure, just dip into the tables for whatever you need at the time.

ODD BEHAVIOR
Odd behaviors have to be something that the Referee can mimic while the adventurers are talking to people in the city/settlement, or they won’t make much of an impression on the players. When this works, however, the players will definitely remember
the city. These are cultural behaviors that the entire city (or a subgroup) uses, not just distinctive mannerisms of a single individual.

Author’s Favorite Method
The author’s favorite method for inventing a city is to begin by rolling for the identity of the town’s central open area (Table
4-25), and to assume that this says a great deal about the city’s personality. A city with its central area and culture based on a
huge graveyard is a very different place from a city that centers on a gladiatorial arena, which is in turn different from a city built
around a sacred flower-garden. This open area will be large, centrally located, and it will play a large part in the city’s culture.
Then draw a couple of main streets leading to the city gates from the central area, and a couple of cross streets so the city
map isn’t just one large hub, and you’re good to go.

City Districts (d100)
Segregated: not necessarily indicating poverty, a segregated district is an area where members of a specific caste,
species, nationality, social status, occupation, or religion are concentrated. Laws in particularly oppressive cities
might require this sort of segregation, or it might simply be that members of the group prefer to self-segregate,
gravitating to the same neighborhoods out of choice. In particular, foreigners who speak a different language
than the predominant one will frequently congregate in one area.

ABSTRACT CITY-ENCOUNTER GENERATOR
This generator is much too open-ended for use at the gaming table, but it can be useful for designing your own city encounter tables, if that’s the way you want to handle running your city. The table defines the basic outline of the encounter in broad
parameters, which can then be fleshed out.

wilderness. There is a 50% chance that the site has a natural feature. (See table below).

Shrine: A shrine is a man-made place of worship that has no buildings or dedicated priesthood (although priests might stop
by, or maintain the shrine from some other location). The shrine is likely a statue of some kind, although there might be a small
structure build to protect whatever constitutes the shrine. A shrine has a 25% chance to be built on Holy Ground (see table
below), but it would not have a natural feature in addition to the shrine.
Chapel: A chapel is a building (or room) for small worship services. In some cases (50%) the chapel will have a full-time
priest in attendance. If not, a priest from some other location comes to officiate at services. A historical example of chapels

comes from the middle ages, when noble families would often have private chapels in their castles or manor houses, with the
parish priest coming to hold private services for the noble family. However, it is quite possible for chapels to be completely separate from other buildings (which is the assumption here). If there is a full-time priest at the chapel, there is a 20% chance that
the chapel has an Administrative Function in addition to its purely religious function – see the tables below to determine what
that function is. Any chapel, whether there is a full-time priest or not, has a 30% chance to be built on Holy Ground, and a 10%
chance to house a relic (see table).

Small Temple: A small temple is a Temple Structure containing quarters for priests and a worship area. The temple will
have 1d2 priests and 1d4 acolytes. It has a 40% chance to be built on Holy Ground, a 30% chance to house a relic (see table),
and a 30% chance to have an Administrative Function.
Large Temple: A large temple is a Temple Structure containing quarters for 1d4+1 priests, 1d4+1 acolytes. It has a 60%
chance to be built on Holy Ground, a 60% chance to house a relic, and will have 1d2 Administrative Functions.

A fashion in behavior or dress becomes prevalent. Perhaps a particular type of fur is a must-have, biting a
dwarf and surviving is a status symbol, owning a pet jaguar is spiritually enlightening, etc.

11-20

A religious sect is rising rapidly in popularity. Existing, entrenched temples are forced to respond with changing
approaches and they may try to discredit or outlaw the popular movement.

21-30

A secular belief begins to spread, causing strife and intense debate. Examples might include the belief that
a minority group is inherently superior or inferior, that the common people should have rights (or that they
shouldn’t), or that certain animals are dangerous.

31-40

New form of music, poetry, art, or sculpture is considered obscene, scandalous, satirically offensive to the
nobility, irreligious, or dangerous to the established social order.

41-50

New literature or lyric forms are rediscovered by translators or imported from a foreign country. These are
considered dangerous by traditionalists and those entrenched in power based on tradition.

Political power vacuum allows a militaristic faction to increase its power without being checked by the normal
safeguards of society. This might be a militant temple, followers of a particular noble, the nobility in general,
organized crime, or demagogues.

61-70

Social change causes widespread unemployment – an influx of workers, the belief that certain forms of work
are demeaning or immoral, the rapid development of a caste system, etc).

71-80

Technological changes cause or threaten widespread unemployment (introduction of new farming techniques,
more efficient looms for weaving, or even something more fantastic, like magical sewing needles).

81-90

There is an influx of foreigners from foreign wars or famines, from movement of nomadic people, or from new
trade routes opening up. Another possibility is simply that rural peasants are moving into a city because there
are more jobs (or vice versa). The “natives” perceive economic and social risks from the foreigners, and tensions
increase, possibly to the point of new political factions and widespread violence.

91-00

Trade and crafts generate more money than farming, with the result that trade guilds and merchants begin
pushing their way into the upper classes. Traditional nobility may respond with laws or even violence against
the “upstarts.” This is also the sort of conflict that leads to the establishment of new political factions.

PLANAR ADVENTURES
NOTES ON PLANAR ADVENTURES
Planar adventures are difficult to design, but they can produce some of the most exciting peak moments in a long-running
campaign. They often represent the culmination of some sort of effort, and they are in many ways the “badge” of an experienced adventuring party. However, what makes a planar adventure distinct from other adventures is also what makes it difficult
to design – some of the ground rules of normal reality are changed, which means a lot of pre-planning by the Referee to make

Underwater
A triangle
Scales in balance
Consumes a
particular resource
Swims through
stone

these changes work well as part of an adventure. The adventure needs to be (a) highly creative in terms of these changes, but
also (b) still playable. If the players can’t quickly grasp what their characters’ new capabilities and restrictions are, the whole
situation will seem random and contrived.
By using these tables, you’ll get ideas for consistent (but weird) physical rules that might apply across the board in the new
plane, or at least in the area where the adventure takes place. Having the idea established as a “rule” will help you to build more
ideas from it, and will allow you to convey more easily to the players what their new capabilities, risks, and limitations are.
After you’ve decided what will be “new” in the planar environment, a good way to make sure it will be a fun setting is to
review some of the basic tenets of the game – if your planar setting takes advantage of these elements, then you are probably on
track:

The lights show
the way

1) It’s a game of resource management. What unusual resources do the characters need in this plane/dimension, and how are

these used up? One possible factor in a good planar adventure is an unusual (or possibly bizarre) resource that the players must

storage rooms

in an airless pocket dimension, to something like Zo-Tcha eggs that you make up as a truly unique resource.

Not much time left

decide when to use and when to conserve. This could range from potions of fire resistance in an elemental plane, to air supply

2) It’s a game of exploration. Beware the tendency to make other planes of existence into a single type of terrain with little
variation and few landmarks.

3) It’s a game of tactics – have you used the planar/dimensional setting to create unusual tactical challenges with odd combat/spell effects?
4) It’s a game of challenging the players’ skill. Does your planar adventure only challenge the character sheet (i.e., using saving throws and damage), or are you also using the setting to create challenges that can only be solved by smart thinking?

TYPES OF PLANAR ADVENTURES
The tables here are divided up into different types of other planes of existence: Alternate Worlds/Realities, Supernatural
Planes (ghostly and wraith-like), Dimensional Planes, Spirit Planes (as in, living animal and totem spirits, not the ghosts of dead
people), Hells and Demonic Regions, Cthonic Planes (utterly alien and generally sanity-destroying), and Dream Realms.

Certain terrible events might “replay themselves,” causing danger to those who are caught up in the echo –
which, to them, would effectively be truly happening.

11-20

Despair, greed, rage, or other mental state creeps up on characters if they fail periodic saving throws

21-30

Each encounter with beings in the plane involves a test of wills, with failure indicating that the loser has come, to
some degree or other, under the control of the other creature. The characters might have an item that lets them
do the same thing, too – building up an army of ghouls as they approach the King Wraith’s vast castle…

31-40

Effect on healing or other beneficial clerical-type spells. If the plane’s ghostly powers are antithetical to certain
religious powers, those powers might be weakened in the other plane of existence.

41-50

Material plane is visible, but there is a constant risk of becoming separated from it (either a flat probability
checked at intervals, or actions create a risk of separation to some increasing degree)

51-60

Places may have “echo” powers – one of the main concepts of a supernatural plane is ghostliness, and places
exert compelling powers in many ghost stories.

61-70

Presence of an undead type that is not ordinarily found in material planes (see Tables 2-64 through 2-68 for
ideas)

71-80

Presence of one normal, living species that one would not expect to find here. For instance, a wraith world
where normal, living wolves are found. Or small frogs. Any possibility is a bit spooky; the animals might be
helpful, hostile, or just part of the weirdness of the scenery.

81-90

Risk of becoming possessed – although possession is often associated with demons, it’s a good ghostly risk as
well. Thinking up some unusual characteristic of ghostly possession would add a great deal of spice to the
“flavor” of the plane.

An item that is worn allows a person to shift into a
different plane. For an interesting twist, the item might
only have enough of a “charge” to allow a certain
period of time in the other plane, after which the
wearer would be pulled back into the original plane
of existence until the item has recharged and can be
used again.

Having used this particular gate as opposed to another
leaves a visible mark or aura on the characters in the
other plane. Perhaps there is a “superior” gate and an
“inferior” gate – hopefully the players picked the right
one!

11-20

Archway or other architectural feature that the
traveler walks through

Having used this particular gate, as opposed to
another, determines the physical form or abilities the
characters will have on the other side. Preferably they
picked the “Dragon” gate and not the “Mouse” gate,
for example.

21-30

Being perceived by a particular thing, whether this
is a divine being, a mirror, a monster, or an item.
Venturing into a divine grove might be perfectly safe
unless the ancient tree of skulls actually awakens and
banishes the party into the realm of ghosts…

The gateway leads to a very remote place in the
other plane (whatever that means in terms of the
physical laws of the other plane). Excellent for stealthy
operations.

31-40

Consuming some item, such as a lotus blossom

The manner in which the gateway is used actually
creates the other plane rather than simply “reaching”
it.

41-50

No physical aspect; travel to the other plane
is accomplished mentally or by use of a spell,
incantation, or similar spoken ritual. The physical
body might or might not be left behind.

Use of the gateway creates a physical effect (all the
way from a little alarm bell up to possibly a massive
earthquake) somewhere in one of the two planes.

51-60

Performing a series of acts, normally with particular
physical components such as a flint blade, a particular
incense, etc.

No particular other aspect of the gateway.

CARAVANS AND CARGO
Caravans are such a staple feature of wilderness fantasy gaming that these tables are included in the general category. Most
caravans will have some passengers; the table also indicates additional passengers (usually suggesting that the passengers are in
some way different from the normal run of the mill).

PART TWO: DESERT WILDERNESS TABLES
Deserts are actually a lot more interesting than the featureless seas of sand many people think of. There are several different
types of deserts, and they are populated with an extraordinary variety of plant and animal life (although more sparsely than the
more hospitable terrain types). One particular thing to keep in mind about deserts is that sand moves constantly as a result of

Table 4-81: Types of Deserts
Desert Type

Description

Coastal Desert

Coastal deserts are created because of cold ocean currents running parallel to the coastline. Such
deserts often experience ground-covering fog, but little precipitation.

Midlatitude Desert

Areas located far from oceans, and are watersheds which receive little rainfall. Temperatures in
midlatitude deserts vary considerably with the season, rather than being tremendously hot all the
time. The Tengger Desert in China, and the Sonoran Desert in Mexico are examples of this sort of
desert.

An attribute of
mold
Velvet cloth
Riddle of the
Oracle
Hunting

Monsoon Desert

Monsoon deserts are areas where seasonal storms run out of moisture before reaching the desert
area.

Reeds on the
riverbank

Montaine Desert

Montaine deserts are high-altitude areas far from any significant body of water. The Tibetan plateau
contains a significant area of Montaine Desert.

Theoretically
impossible, but
workable

Polar Desert

Deserts in polar regions are generally plains of gravel or plain bedrock rather than sand. In polar
deserts where precipitation occurs, there can be incidence of snow dunes.

Green spirals

Rain Shadow Desert

A tall mountain range blocks clouds from moving into the desert region. The Tian Shan Desert in
China is an example of a Rain Shadow Desert

Trade Wind Desert

Predominant wind currents heat up and dissipate cloud cover, causing more sun to hit the area. The
Sahara is an example of this type of desert.

Secrets

Table 4-82: Desert Map Features
Area

Description

Badlands (clay-rich area)

Arid areas with high clay content eroded by wind or water are called badlands. They have a
number of unique geographical features including canyons, gullies, and hoodoos. A hoodoo
is a tall spire of rock left behind after the surrounding area is eroded away. Many of these
form because there is a more durable rock at the top, acting as a “cap” to protect the lower
portion of the spire from the elements.

Dunes

Dunes can form from snow in polar deserts, and from sand in hotter deserts. They have
a gentle slope on one side and a steeper slope on the lee side (where the blown-over sand
causes avalanches).

Dust Devils

Cyclonic storms of very small particles, reaching as high as one kilometer. Caused by
extreme temperature differentials in close areas.

Ephemeral Stream

Runoff from nearby mountains can cause short-lived rivers or streams in a desert

Exotic River

Most deserts are watersheds which receive little moisture (the moisture all goes to the
adjoining watersheds). However, in some cases a river with a very strong source, such as the
Nile or the Colorado River, moves through a desert.

Lakes

Desert lakes can form when there is sufficient runoff from nearby mountains. They are
shallow and broad, and wind can actually cause the lake to move from one place to another.

Loess

Silt deposits, often as deep as 20-30 meters, with one deposit 355 meters deep.

Mineral Deposits

Deserts contain metals no less than temperate regions, so it is possible to find valuable
gold, silver, or copper deposits. In particular, though, deserts have unusual mineral deposits
caused by evaporation. Not all of these would be particularly interesting in a fantasy
campaign, but unusual salts and other minerals might be used in magical potions, making
expeditions into the desert a worthwhile venture.

Oasis

An oasis is an area where underground springs or seepage can create small lakes, tree
growth, and crop growth in areas where precipitation alone would not permit crop growth.
The soils are not usually very good; they are high in organic content, but often saline.
However, it would be possible to have an oasis where the soil was incredibly fertile – it’s just
not likely under real-world terrestrial conditions.

Playa

Flat area caused by the existence of a dry desert lakebed. Usually crusted with salt or clay
as a result of the lake’s presence.

Ripples

Ripples can be as large as small dunes, but don’t necessarily have the gentle slope/ steep
slope formation of a true dune.

Sand Sheet

Flat sand. Boring, but this is what covers about 40% of deserts, as opposed to areas with
dunes. The reason why dunes don’t form is because the sand particles in a sand sheet are
too large for significant wind movement.

Wadi

Dry streambeds left by flash flooding or ephemeral streams. During torrential desert rain,
these can be extremely dangerous.

Traviss Smelser (Order #35989022)

Tome of Adventure Design is a comprehensive, start-to-finish resource for
designing fantasy adventures for your favorite tabletop role-playing game. It
is system neutral, and can be used with virtually any fantasy game. This book
includes random generation tables for almost every step of the design process:
locations, villainous plots, designing new monsters, and bizarre environments
in strange, unknown planes of existence. Thousands of micro-prompts in the
margins add additional brainstorming power to the process, and the book is
filled with design advice from award-winning author Matt Finch.
“If you want a comprehensive tome for helping you design campaigns and
dungeons and adventures in general, this is pretty much unsurpassed. It is THE
book to get on that subject. I strongly recommend it.”
---Questing Beast, Sept. 5, 2018
“It’s over 300 pages of randomly selected jolts to the brain. In the introduction,
Finch states that the point of incorporating randomness into your adventure
writing is “to deliver cryptic results designed to shock the reader’s creativity
into filling in the gaps” ... Let me emphasize his use of the word “shock” in
that passage. It’s perfect. The moment when two, three, or more nonsensical,
fragmentary, contradictory notions gel into a coherent and fresh idea is
shocking. It’s revelatory. It’s magical. And it’s inspiring…”
