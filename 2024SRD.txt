Playing the Game
Rhythm of Play
The three main pillars of D&D play are social interaction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one
you’re experiencing, the game unfolds according to
this basic pattern:

1: The Game Master Describes a Scene. The GM
tells the players where their adventurers are and
what’s around them (how many doors lead out of
a room, what’s on a table, and so on).
2: The Players Describe What Their Characters
Do. Typically, the characters stick together as
they travel through a dungeon or another environment. Sometimes different adventurers do
different things: one adventurer might search a
treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious symbol engraved on a wall and a third
keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the
GM ensures that every character has a chance to
act and decides how to resolve their activity. In
combat, the characters take turns.
3: The GM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers’ Actions. Sometimes resolving a task is easy.
If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to
open a door, the GM might say the door opens and
describe what lies beyond. But the door might be
locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other
circumstance might make it challenging for an
adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the
GM might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings
the game back to step 1.
This pattern holds during every game session
(each time you sit down to play D&D), whether the

Exceptions Supersede General Rules

General rules govern each part of the game. For
example, the combat rules tell you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity.
That’s a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as
long as something in the game doesn’t explicitly say
otherwise.
The game also includes elements—class features,
feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general
rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a
feature says you can make melee attacks using your
Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement
disagrees with the general rule.

5

System Reference Document 5.2.1

adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin,
or fighting a dragon. In certain situations—particularly combat—the action is more structured, and
everyone takes turns.

The Six Abilities

All creatures—characters and monsters—have six
abilities that measure physical and mental characteristics, as shown on the Ability Descriptions table.

Ability Descriptions
Ability

Score Measures …

Strength

Physical might

Dexterity

Agility, reflexes, and balance

Constitution

Health and stamina

Intelligence

Reasoning and memory

Wisdom

Perceptiveness and mental fortitude

Charisma

Confidence, poise, and charm

Ability Scores
Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some
monsters have a score as high as 30. The score
represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability
Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.

Ability Scores
Score

Meaning

1

This is the lowest a score can normally go.
If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect
explains what happens.

2–9

This represents a weak capability.

10–11

This represents the human average.

12–19

This represents a strong capability.

20

This is the highest an adventurer’s score can
go unless a feature says otherwise.

21–29

This represents an extraordinary capability.

30

This is the highest a score can go.

Ability Modifiers
Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever
you make a D20 Test with that ability (explained in
“D20 Tests”). An ability modifier is derived from its
score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.

Round Down
Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the
game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even
if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make
an exception and tell you to round up.

D20 Tests
When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the
game uses a d20 roll to determine success or failure. These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come
in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and
attack rolls. They follow these steps:

4: Roll 1d20. You always want to roll high. If the
roll has Advantage or Disadvantage (described
later in “Playing the Game”), you roll two d20s,
but you use the number from only one of them—
the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower
one if you have Disadvantage.
5: Add Modifiers. Add these modifiers to the number rolled on the d20:

• The Relevant Ability Modifier. “Playing the
Game” and “Rules Glossary” explain which ability
modifiers to use for various D20 Tests.
• Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant. Each creature has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added
when making a D20 Test that uses something,
such as a skill, in which the creature has proficiency. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the
Game.”
• Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties. A class
feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus
or penalty to the die roll.
6: Compare the Total to a Target Number. If the
total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or exceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds.
Otherwise, it fails. The Game Master determines
target numbers and tells players whether their
rolls are successful. The target number for an
ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack
roll is called an Armor Class (AC), which appears
on a character sheet or in a stat block (see “Rules
Glossary”).

System Reference Document 5.2.1

An ability check represents a creature using talent
and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as
forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertaining a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The GM and the
rules often call for an ability check when a creature
attempts something other than an attack that has a
chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is
uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the result.

Ability Modifier

An ability check is named for the ability modifier it
uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so
on. Different ability checks are called for in different situations, depending on which ability is most
relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for
examples of each check’s use.

Ability Check Examples
Ability

Make a Check To …

Strength

Lift, push, pull, or break something

Dexterity

Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly

Constitution

Push your body beyond normal limits

Intelligence

Reason or remember

Wisdom

Notice things in the environment or in
creatures’ behavior

Charisma

Influence, entertain, or deceive

Proficiency Bonus
Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check
when the GM determines that a skill or tool proficiency is relevant to the check and you have
that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a
Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can
add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have
proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See
“Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for more
information about skill and tool proficiencies.

Difficulty Class

The Difficulty Class of an ability check represents
the task’s difficulty. The more difficult the task,
the higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain
checks, but the GM ultimately sets them. The Typical Difficulty Classes table presents a range of possible DCs for ability checks.

Typical Difficulty Classes

Saving Throws

Attack Roll Abilities

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an
attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery
explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying
to invade your mind. You don’t normally choose to
make a save; you must make one because your character or a monster (if you’re the GM) is at risk. A
save’s result is detailed in the effect that caused it.
If you don’t want to resist the effect, you can
choose to fail the save without rolling.

Varies

Spell attack (the ability used is determined
by the spellcaster’s spellcasting feature, as
explained in “Spells”)

Ability Modifier

Saving throws are named for the ability modifiers
they use: a Constitution saving throw, a Wisdom
saving throw, and so on. Different saving throws are
used to resist different kinds of effects, as shown on
the Saving Throw Examples table.

Saving Throw Examples
Ability

Make a Save To …

Strength

Physically resist direct force

Dexterity

Dodge out of harm’s way

Constitution

Endure a toxic hazard

Intelligence

Recognize an illusion as fake

Wisdom

Resist a mental assault

Charisma

Assert your identity

Proficiency Bonus
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your saving
throw if you have proficiency in that kind of save.
See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game.”

Difficulty Class

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it or by the GM. For
example, if a spell forces you to make a save, the DC
is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability
and Proficiency Bonus. Monster abilities that call
for saves specify the DC.

Attack Rolls

An attack roll determines whether an attack hits
a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or
exceeds the target’s Armor Class. Attack rolls usually occur in battle, described in “Combat” later in
“Playing the Game,” but the GM might also ask for
an attack roll in other situations, such as an archery
competition.

Ability Modifier

The Attack Roll Abilities table shows which ability
modifier to use for different types of attack rolls.

7

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Some features let you use different ability modifiers
from those listed. For example, the Finesse property
(see “Equipment”) lets you use Strength or Dexterity with a weapon that has that property.

Proficiency Bonus

You add your Proficiency Bonus to your attack roll
when you attack using a weapon you have proficiency with, as well as when you attack with a spell.
See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for
more information about weapon proficiencies.

Armor Class

A creature’s Armor Class represents how well the
creature avoids being wounded in combat. The AC
of a character is determined at character creation
(see “Character Creation”), whereas the AC of a
monster appears in its stat block.
Calculating AC. All creatures start with the same
base AC calculation:
Base AC = 10 + the creature’s Dexterity modifier

A creature’s AC can then be modified by armor,
magic items, spells, and more.
Only One Base AC. Some spells and class features
give characters a different way to calculate their AC.
A character with multiple features that give different ways to calculate AC must choose which one to
use; only one base calculation can be in effect for a
creature.

Rolling 20 or 1

If you roll a 20 on the d20 (called a “natural 20”) for
an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a Critical Hit
(see “Combat” later in “Playing the Game”).
If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a “natural 1”) for an attack roll, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.

Advantage/Disadvantage

Sometimes a D20 Test is modified by Advantage or
Disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while Disadvantage reflects negative circumstances.
You usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage
through the use of special abilities and actions. The

Heroic Inspiration

Proficiency

Sometimes the GM or a rule gives you Heroic Inspiration. If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it
to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you
must use the new roll.
Only One at a Time. You can never have more
than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something
gives you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it,
you can give it to a player character in your group
who lacks it.
Gaining Heroic Inspiration. Your GM can
give you Heroic Inspiration for a variety of reasons.
Typically, GMs award it when you do something particularly heroic, in character, or entertaining. It’s a
reward for making the game more fun for everyone
playing.
Other rules might allow your character to gain
Heroic Inspiration independent of the GM’s decision.
For example, Human characters start each day with
Heroic Inspiration.

Characters and monsters are good at various
things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while
others can use only a few. Some are better at understanding people’s motives, and others are better at
unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the
impact that training has on the creature’s capabilities. A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as
the character gains levels (described in “Character
Creation”). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based
on its Challenge Rating (see “Rules Glossary”). The
Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is
determined.
This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or
with an item that the creature uses to make the D20
Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for
calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.

GM can also decide that circumstances grant Advantage or impose Disadvantage.

Roll Two D20s

When a roll has either Advantage or Disadvantage,
roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the
higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and
use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For example, if you have Disadvantage and roll an 18 and a
3, use the 3. If you instead have Advantage and roll
those numbers, use the 18.

They Don’t Stack

If multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant
Advantage on it, you still roll only two d20s. Similarly, if multiple situations impose Disadvantage on
a roll, you roll only two d20s.
If circumstances cause a roll to have both Advantage and Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them,
and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple
circumstances impose Disadvantage and only one
grants Advantage or vice versa. In such a situation,
you have neither Advantage nor Disadvantage.

Interactions with Rerolls

When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and
something in the game lets you reroll or replace the
d20, you can reroll or replace only one die, not both.
You choose which one.
For example, if you have Heroic Inspiration (see
the sidebar below) and roll a 3 and an 18 on an ability check that has Advantage or Disadvantage, you
could expend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one
of those dice, not both of them.

The Bonus Doesn’t Stack
Your Proficiency Bonus can’t be added to a die roll
or another number more than once. For example, if
a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or
Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus
if you’re proficient in either skill, but you don’t add
it twice if you’re proficient in both skills.
Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example)
before being added. For example, the Expertise
feature (see “Rules Glossary”) doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever
the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and
divided only once.

Skill Proficiencies

Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with
an ability check. The descriptions of the actions
you take (see “Actions” later in “Playing the Game”)
specify which skill applies if you make an ability
check for that action, and many other rules note
when a skill is relevant. The GM has the ultimate say
on whether a skill is relevant in a situation.
If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature
applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks involving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a
creature can still make ability checks involving

that skill but doesn’t add its Proficiency Bonus. For
example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the GM
might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the
character has Athletics proficiency, the character
adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check.
If the character lacks that proficiency, they make
the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.

Skill List

The skills are shown on the Skills table, which notes
example uses for each skill proficiency as well as
the ability check the skill most often applies to.

Determining Skills

A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill
proficiencies appear in its stat block.

Saving Throw Proficiencies

Proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add
their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a particular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom
saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your
Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving
throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.
Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving
throws, representing that class’s training in evading
or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example,
are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves;
they train to resist mental assault.

9

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Equipment Proficiencies
A character gains proficiency with various weapons
and tools from their class and background. There
are two categories of equipment proficiency:

Weapons. Anyone can wield a weapon, but proficiency makes you better at wielding it. If you have
proficiency with a weapon, you add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it.
Tools. If you have proficiency with a tool, you can
add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check
you make that uses the tool. If you have proficiency in the skill that’s also used with that check,
you have Advantage on the check too. This means
you can benefit from both skill proficiency and
tool proficiency on the same ability check.

Actions

When you do something other than moving or communicating, you typically take an action. The Action
table lists the game’s main actions, which are defined in more detail in “Rules Glossary.”

Actions
Action

Summary

Attack

Attack with a weapon or an Unarmed

you make Dexterity saving throws with
Advantage. You lose this benefit if you
have the Incapacitated condition or if your
Speed is 0.

Help

Help another creature’s ability check or
attack roll, or administer first aid.

Hide

Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.

Influence

Make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation,
Performance, or Persuasion) or Wisdom
(Animal Handling) check to alter a creature’s attitude.

Magic

Cast a spell, use a magic item, or use a
magical feature.

Ready

Prepare to take an action in response to a
trigger you define.

Search

Make a Wisdom (Insight, Medicine,
Perception, or Survival) check.

Study

Make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion) check.

Utilize

Use a nonmagical object.

Player characters and monsters can also do things
not covered by these actions. Many class features
and other abilities provide additional action options, and you can improvise other actions. When
you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the
rules, the Game Master tells you whether that action
is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to
make, if any.

One Thing at a Time

The game uses actions to govern how much you can
do at one time. You can take only one action at a
time. This principle is most important in combat, as
explained in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”
Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a
social interaction, you can try to Influence a creature or use the Search action to read the creature’s
body language, but you can’t do both at the same
time. And when you’re exploring a dungeon, you
can’t simultaneously use the Search action to look
for traps and use the Help action to aid another
character who’s trying to open a stuck door (with
the Utilize action).

Bonus Actions

10

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let
you take an additional action on your turn called
a Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for

System Reference Document 5.2.1

example, allows a Rogue to take a Bonus Action. You
can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability,
a spell, or another feature of the game states that
you can do something as a Bonus Action. You otherwise don’t have a Bonus Action to take.
You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn,
so you must choose which Bonus Action to use if you
have more than one available.
You choose when to take a Bonus Action during
your turn unless the Bonus Action’s timing is specified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to
take actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus
Action.

Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a Reaction. A
Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some
kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone
else’s. The Opportunity Attack, described later in
“Playing the Game,” is the most common type of
Reaction.
When you take a Reaction, you can’t take another
one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction
interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature
can continue its turn right after the Reaction.
In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immediately after its trigger unless the Reaction’s description says otherwise.

Social Interaction

During their adventures, player characters meet
many different people and face some monsters that
would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it’s
time for social interaction, which takes many forms.
For example, you might try to convince a burglar to
confess to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The
Game Master assumes the roles of any nonplayer
characters who are participating.
An NPC’s attitude toward your character is
Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile, as defined in “Rules
Glossary.” Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help,
and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder.
Social interactions progress in two ways: through
roleplaying and ability checks.

Roleplaying

Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role.
In this case, it’s you as a player determining how
your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is
part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the
fore during social interactions.
As you roleplay, consider whether you prefer an
active approach or a descriptive approach.
The GM uses an NPC’s personality and your character’s actions and attitudes to determine how an

NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under
threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant
refuses to help if the characters badger her. A vain
dragon laps up flattery.
When interacting with an NPC, pay attention to
the GM’s portrayal of the NPC’s personality. You
might be able to learn an NPC’s goals and then use
that information to influence the NPC.
If you offer NPCs something they want or play
on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you can form
friendships, ward off violence, or learn a key piece
of information. On the other hand, if you insult a
proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your
efforts to convince or deceive will likely fail.

Ability Checks

Ability checks can be key in determining the outcome of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts
can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be
an element of chance if the GM wants dice to play
a role in determining an NPC’s response to you. In
such situations, the GM will typically ask you to
take the Influence action.
Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when
thinking of how you will interact with an NPC; use
an approach that relies on your group’s skill proficiencies. For example, if the group needs to trick
a guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue
who is proficient in Deception should lead the
discussion.

Exploration

Exploration involves delving into places that are
dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this section detail some of the ways adventurers interact
with the environment in such places.

Adventuring Equipment

As adventurers explore, their equipment can help
them in many ways. For example, they can reach
out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things
they wouldn’t otherwise notice with a Torch or
another light source, bypass locked doors and containers with Thieves’ Tools, and create obstacles for
pursuers with Caltrops.
See “Equipment” for rules on many items that are
useful on adventures. The items in the“Tools” and
“Adventuring Gear” sections are especially useful.
The weapons in “Equipment” can also be used for
more than battle; you could use a Quarterstaff,
for example, to push a sinister-looking button that
you’re reluctant to touch.

11

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Vision and Light
Some adventuring tasks—such as noticing danger,
hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells—are
affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can
hinder you, as explained below.

Obscured Areas

An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a
Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with Dim
Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage—you have
Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that
rely on sight.
A Heavily Obscured area—such as an area with
Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage—is opaque.
You have the Blinded condition (see “Rules Glossary”) when trying to see something there.

Light

The presence or absence of light determines the category of illumination in an area, as defined below.
Bright Light. Bright Light lets most creatures see
normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as
do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.
Dim Light. Dim Light, also called shadows, creates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light
is usually a boundary between Bright Light and
surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and
dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might
bathe the land in Dim Light.
Darkness. Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured
area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night
(even most moonlit nights), within the confines of
an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.

Special Senses

Some creatures have special senses that help them
perceive things in certain situations. “Rules Glossary” defines the following special senses:
Blindsight
Darkvision
Tremorsense
Truesight

Hiding
Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to
spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an
ambush. The Game Master decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to
hide, you take the Hide action.

Interacting with Objects

Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve.
The player tells the GM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever or opening

a door, and the GM describes what happens. Sometimes, however, rules govern what you can do with
an object, as detailed in the following sections.

What Is an Object?

For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete,
inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book,
table, chair, or stone. It isn’t a building or a vehicle,
which are composed of many objects.

Time-Limited Object Interactions

When time is short, such as in combat, interactions
with objects are limited: one free interaction per
turn. That interaction must occur during a creature’s movement or action. Any additional interactions require the Utilize action, as explained in
“Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”

Finding Hidden Objects

When your character searches for hidden things,
such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks
you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided
you describe the character searching in the hidden
object’s vicinity. On a success, you find the object,
other important details, or both.
If you describe your character searching nowhere
near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check
won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total.

Carrying Objects

You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight of those objects. If
you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the GM might require
you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity in
“Rules Glossary.”

Breaking Objects

As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such
as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to
damage something more resilient, the GM might use
the rules on breaking objects in “Rules Glossary.”

Marching Order

The adventurers should establish a marching order
while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A
marching order makes it easier to determine which
characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot
hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to
those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change
your marching order outside combat and record the
order any way you like: write it down, for example,
or arrange miniatures to show it.

12

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Hazards
Monsters are the main perils characters face, but
other dangers await. “Rules Glossary” defines the
following hazards:
Burning
Dehydration

Falling
Malnutrition

Suffocation

Travel
During an adventure, the characters might travel
long distances on trips that could take hours or
days. The GM can summarize this travel without
calculating exact distances or travel times, or the
GM might have you use the travel pace rules below.
If you need to know how fast you can move when
every second matters, see the movement rules in
“Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”

Travel Pace

While traveling outside combat, a group can move
at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the
Travel Pace table. The table states how far the
party can move in a period of time; if riding horses
or other mounts, the group can move twice that
distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a
Short or Long Rest before they can move at that increased pace again (see “Equipment” for a selection
of mounts for sale). “Gameplay Toolbox” has rules
that affect which pace you can choose in certain
types of terrain.

Each travel pace has a game effect, as defined below.
Fast. Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvantage on a traveler’s Wisdom (Perception or Survival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Normal. Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Slow. Traveling at a Slow pace grants Advantage
on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks.

Vehicles

Travelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel,
and they don’t choose a travel pace. Depending on
the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be
able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. “Equipment” includes vehicles for sale.

Combat
Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters
and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat
often breaks out.

The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two
sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries,
footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes
combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round
represents about 6 seconds in the game world.
During a round, each participant in a battle takes a
turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once
everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the
next round if neither side is defeated.

Combat Step by Step

Combat unfolds in these steps:

1: Establish Positions. The Game Master determines where all the characters and monsters are
located. Given the adventurers’ marching order
or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries
are—how far away and in what direction.
2: Roll Initiative. Everyone involved in the combat
encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order
of combatants’ turns.
3: Take Turns. Each participant in the battle takes
a turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round
ends. Repeat this step until the fighting stops.

Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during
combat. When combat starts, every participant
rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that
determines their place in the Initiative order. The
GM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical creatures, the GM makes a single roll, so each member of
the group has the same Initiative.
Surprise. If a combatant is surprised by combat
starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their
Initiative roll. For example, if an ambusher starts
combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware
that combat is starting, that foe is surprised.
Initiative Order. A combatant’s check total is
called their Initiative count, or Initiative for short.
The GM ranks the combatants, from highest to
lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act
during each round. The Initiative order remains the
same from round to round.
Ties. If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order
among tied monsters, and the players decide the
order among tied characters. The GM decides the

13

System Reference Document 5.2.1

order if the tie is between a monster and a player
character.

Your Turn

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your
Speed and take one action. You decide whether to
move first or take your action first.
The main actions you can take are listed in “Actions” earlier in “Playing the Game.” A character’s
features and a monster’s stat block also provide
action options. “Movement and Position” later in
“Playing the Game” gives the rules for movement.
Communicating. You can communicate however
you are able—through brief utterances and gestures—as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither
your action nor your move.
Extended communication, such as a detailed explanation of something or an attempt to persuade a
foe, requires an action. The Influence action is the
main way you try to influence a monster.
Interacting with Things. You can interact with
one object or feature of the environment for free,
during either your move or action. For example, you
could open a door during your move as you stride
toward a foe.
If you want to interact with a second object, you
need to take the Utilize action. Some magic items
and other special objects always require an action
to use, as stated in their descriptions.

Playing on a Grid

If you play using a square grid and miniatures or
other tokens, follow these rules.
Squares. Each square represents 5 feet.
Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move
square by square on the grid, using your Speed in
5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed into
squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a Speed of
30 feet translates into 6 squares. If you use a grid often, consider writing your Speed in squares on your
character sheet.
Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must
have enough movement left to pay for entering. It
costs 1 square of movement to enter an unoccupied
square that’s adjacent to your space (orthogonally
or diagonally adjacent). A square of Difficult Terrain
costs 2 squares to enter. Other effects might make a
square cost even more.
Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, a large tree, or another terrain feature
that fills its space.
Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—
count squares from a square adjacent to one of them
and stop counting in the space of the other one.
Count by the shortest route.

The GM might require you to use an action for
any of these activities when it needs special care or
when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance,
the GM might require you to take the Utilize action
to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a
drawbridge.
Doing Nothing on Your Turn. You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on
your turn. If you can’t decide what to do, consider
taking the defensive Dodge action or the Ready action to delay acting.

Ending Combat

Combat ends when one side or the other is defeated,
which can mean the creatures are killed or knocked
out or have surrendered or fled. Combat can also
end when both sides agree to end it.

Movement and Position

On your turn, you can move a distance equal to your
Speed or less. Or you can decide not to move.
Your movement can include climbing, crawling,
jumping, and swimming (each explained in “Rules
Glossary”). These different modes of movement can
be combined with your regular movement, or they
can constitute your entire move.
However you’re moving with your Speed, you
deduct the distance of each part of your move from
it until it is used up or until you are done moving,
whichever comes first.
A character’s Speed is determined during character creation. A monster’s Speed is noted in the
monster’s stat block. See “Rules Glossary” for more
about Speed as well as about special speeds, such as
a Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed.

Difficult Terrain

Combatants are often slowed down by Difficult
Terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep
stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of Difficult Terrain.
Every foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs
1 extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count
as Difficult Terrain.

Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your move, using some of its
movement before and after any action, Bonus Action, or Reaction you take on the same turn. For
example, if you have a Speed of 30 feet, you could go
10 feet, take an action, and then go 20 feet.

Dropping Prone

On your turn, you can give yourself the Prone condition (see “Rules Glossary”) without using an action
or any of your Speed, but you can’t do so if your
Speed is 0.

14

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Creature Size
A creature belongs to a size category, which determines the width of the square space the creature
occupies on a map, as shown on the Creature Size
and Space table. That table lists the sizes from
smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan). A creature’s
space is the area that it effectively controls in combat and the area it needs to fight effectively.
A character’s size is determined by species, and
a monster’s size is specified in the monster’s stat
block.

Moving around Other Creatures
During your move, you can pass through the space
of an ally, a creature that has the Incapacitated
condition (see “Rules Glossary”), a Tiny creature, or
a creature that is two sizes larger or smaller than
you.
Another creature’s space is Difficult Terrain for
you unless that creature is Tiny or your ally.
You can’t willingly end a move in a space occupied
by another creature. If you somehow end a turn in
a space with another creature, you have the Prone
condition (see “Rules Glossary”) unless you are Tiny
or are of a larger size than the other creature.

Making an Attack

When you take the Attack action, you make an
attack. Some other actions, Bonus Actions, and Reactions also let you make an attack. Whether you
strike with a Melee weapon, fire a Ranged weapon,

Unseen Attackers and Targets

When you make an attack roll against a target you
can’t see, you have Disadvantage on the roll. This is
true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or
targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the
target isn’t in the location you targeted, you miss.
When a creature can’t see you, you have Advantage
on attack rolls against it.
If you are hidden when you make an attack roll,
you give away your location when the attack hits or
misses.

or make an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack
has the following structure:

1: Choose a Target. Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2: Determine Modifiers. The GM determines
whether the target has Cover (see the next section) and whether you have Advantage or Disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells,
special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3: Resolve the Attack. Make the attack roll, as
detailed earlier in “Playing the Game.” On a hit,
you roll damage unless the particular attack
has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks
cause special effects in addition to or instead of
damage.

Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover, making a target more difficult to harm.
As detailed in the Cover table, there are three degrees of cover, each of which gives a different benefit to a target.
A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side
of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources
of cover, only the most protective degree of cover
applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives Half
Cover and a tree trunk that gives Three-Quarters
Cover, the target has Three-Quarters Cover.

Ranged Attacks
When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow,
hurl an axe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a
foe at a distance. Many spells also involve making a
ranged attack.

Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets
within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as
one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t
attack a target beyond this range.

15

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a
Longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is
the normal range, and the larger number is the long
range. Your attack roll has Disadvantage when your
target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack
a target beyond long range.

Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe
is next to you. When you make a ranged attack roll
with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you
have Disadvantage on the roll if you are within 5
feet of an enemy who can see you and doesn’t have
the Incapacitated condition (see “Rules Glossary”).

Melee Attacks

A melee attack allows you to attack a target within
your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon or an Unarmed Strike. Many monsters
make melee attacks with claws, teeth, or other body
parts. A few spells also involve melee attacks.

Reach

A creature has a 5-foot reach and can thus attack
targets within 5 feet when making a melee attack.
Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach
greater than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

Opportunity Attacks

Combatants watch for enemies to drop their guard.
If you move heedlessly past your foes, you put yourself in danger by provoking an Opportunity Attack.
Avoiding Opportunity Attacks. You can avoid
provoking an Opportunity Attack by taking the
Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an Opportunity Attack when you Teleport or when you are
moved without using your movement, action, Bonus
Action, or Reaction. For example, you don’t provoke
an Opportunity Attack if an explosion hurls you out
of a foe’s reach or if you fall past an enemy.
Making an Opportunity Attack. You can make an
Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can
see leaves your reach. To make the attack, take a Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon or
an Unarmed Strike against that creature. The attack
occurs right before it leaves your reach.

Mounted Combat

A willing creature that is at least one size larger
than a rider and that has an appropriate anatomy
can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

Mounting and Dismounting

During your move, you can mount a creature that
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs
an amount of movement equal to half your Speed
(round down). For example, if your Speed is 30 feet,
you spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.

Controlling a Mount
You can control a mount only if it has been trained
to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and
similar creatures have such training.
The Initiative of a controlled mount changes to
match yours when you mount it. It moves on your
turn as you direct it, and it has only three action options during that turn: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge.
A controlled mount can move and act even on the
turn that you mount it.
In contrast, an independent mount—one that lets
you ride but ignores your control—retains its place
in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes.

Falling Off

If an effect is about to move your mount against its
will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity saving throw or fall off, landing with the
Prone condition (see “Rules Glossary”) in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mount.
While mounted, you must make the same save if
you’re knocked Prone or the mount is.

Underwater Combat

A fight underwater follows these rules.

Impeded Weapons

When making a melee attack roll with a weapon
underwater, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed has
Disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon
deals Piercing damage.
A ranged attack roll with a weapon underwater
automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s
normal range, and the attack roll has Disadvantage
against a target within normal range.

Fire Resistance

Anything underwater has Resistance to Fire damage (explained in “Damage and Healing”).

Damage and Healing

Injury and death are frequent threats, as detailed in
the following rules.

Hit Points

Hit Points represent durability and the will to live.
Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult
to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of

Resting

Adventurers can’t spend every hour adventuring.
They need rest. Any creature can take hour-long
Short Rests in the midst of a day and an 8-hour Long
Rest to end it. Regaining Hit Points is one of the main
benefits of a rest. “Rules Glossary” provides the
rules for Short and Long Rests.

16

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current
Hit Points can be any number from that maximum
down to 0, which is the lowest Hit Points can go.
Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your
Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no effect on your capabilities until you reach 0 Hit Points.
If you have half your Hit Points or fewer, you’re
Bloodied, which has no game effect on its own but
which might trigger other game effects.

Damage Rolls

Each weapon, spell, and damaging monster ability
specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage
dice, add any modifiers, and deal the damage to
your target. If there’s a penalty to the damage, it’s
possible to deal 0 damage but not negative damage.
When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack
roll—to the damage roll. A spell tells you which dice
to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don’t add
your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount that
doesn’t use a roll, such as the damage of a Blowgun.
See “Equipment” for weapons’ damage dice and
“Spells” for spells’ damage dice.

Critical Hits

When you score a Critical Hit, you deal extra damage. Roll the attack’s damage dice twice, add them
together, and add any relevant modifiers as normal.
For example, if you score a Critical Hit with a Dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage rather than 1d4, and
add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the Rogue’s
Sneak Attack feature, you also roll those dice twice.

Saving Throws and Damage

Damage dealt via saving throws uses these rules.

Damage against Multiple Targets

When you create a damaging effect that forces two
or more targets to make saving throws against it at
the same time, roll the damage once for all the targets. For example, when a wizard casts Fireball, the
spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught
in the blast.

Half Damage

Many saving throw effects deal half damage (round
down) to a target when the target succeeds on the
saving throw. The halved damage is equal to half
the damage that would be dealt on a failed save.

Damage Types

Each instance of damage has a type, like Fire
or Slashing. Damage types are listed in “Rules

Glossary” and have no rules of their own, but other
rules, such as Resistance, rely on damage types.

Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects have Resistance or
Vulnerability to certain damage types. If you have
Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type
is halved against you (round down). If you have
Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type
is doubled against you. For example, if you have
Resistance to Cold damage, such damage is halved
against you, and if you have Vulnerability to Fire
damage, such damage is doubled against you.

No Stacking

Multiple instances of Resistance or Vulnerability
that affect the same damage type count as only one
instance. For example, if you have Resistance to Necrotic damage as well as Resistance to all damage,
Necrotic damage is reduced by half against you.

Order of Application

Modifiers to damage are applied in the following
order: adjustments such as bonuses, penalties, or
multipliers are applied first; Resistance is applied
second; and Vulnerability is applied third.
For example, a creature has Resistance to all damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage, and it’s within
a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. If it
takes 28 Fire damage, the damage is first reduced
by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature’s Resistance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled for
its Vulnerability (to 22).

Immunity

Some creatures and objects have Immunity to certain damage types and conditions. Immunity to a
damage type means you don’t take damage of that
type, and Immunity to a condition means you aren’t
affected by it.

Healing

Hit Points can be restored by magic, such as the
Cure Wounds spell or a Potion of Healing, or by a
Short or Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”).

Knocking Out a Creature

When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points
with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point and give it the Unconscious condition. It then starts a Short Rest, at the end of which
that condition ends on it. The condition ends early
if the creature regains any Hit Points or if someone
takes an action to administer first aid to it, making a
successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

17

System Reference Document 5.2.1

When you receive healing, add the restored Hit
Points to your current Hit Points. Your Hit Points
can’t exceed your Hit Point maximum, so any Hit
Points regained in excess of the maximum are lost.
For example, if you receive 8 Hit Points of healing
and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of
20, you regain 6 Hit Points, not 8.

Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it either dies
outright or falls unconscious, as explained below.

Instant Death

Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly.
Monster Death. A monster dies the instant it
drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Game Master can
ignore this rule for an individual monster and treat
it like a character.
Hit Point Maximum of 0. A creature dies if its Hit
Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life
energy, reducing a creature’s Hit Point maximum.
Massive Damage. When damage reduces a character to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the character dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their
Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character
has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit
Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to
0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character
then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.

Character Demise

If your character dies, others might find a magical
way to revive your character, such as with the Raise
Dead spell. Or talk with the GM about making a new
character to join the group. “Rules Glossary” has
more information on being dead.

Falling Unconscious

If you reach 0 Hit Points and don’t die instantly, you
have the Unconscious condition (see “Rules Glossary”) until you regain any Hit Points, and you now
face making Death Saving Throws (see below).

Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points,
you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine
whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life.
Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to an
ability score. You’re in the hands of fate now.
Three Successes/Failures. Roll 1d20. If the roll
is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A
success or failure has no effect by itself. On your
third success, you become Stable (see “Stabilizing a
Character” below). On your third failure, you die.
The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three
of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when
you regain any Hit Points or become Stable.

Rolling a 1 or 20. When you roll a 1 on the d20
for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If
you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 Hit Point.
Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage
while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Saving Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical
Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage
equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.

Stabilizing a Character

You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a
creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
A Stable creature doesn’t make Death Saving
Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still
has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes
damage, it stops being Stable and starts making
Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that
isn’t healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.

Temporary Hit Points

Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit
Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit
Points, as explained below.

Lose Temporary Hit Points First

If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage,
those points are lost first, and any leftover damage
carries over to your Hit Points. For example, if you
have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 damage,
you lose those points and then lose 2 Hit Points.

18

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Duration
Temporary Hit Points last until they’re depleted or
you finish a Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”).

They Don’t Stack

Temporary Hit Points can’t be added together. If
you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more
of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you
have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell
grants you 12 Temporary Hit Points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

They’re Not Hit Points or Healing

Temporary Hit Points can’t be added to your Hit
Points, healing can’t restore them, and receiving
Temporary Hit Points doesn’t count as healing. Because Temporary Hit Points aren’t Hit Points, a creature can be at full Hit Points and receive Temporary
Hit Points.
If you have 0 Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit
Points doesn’t restore you to consciousness. Only
true healing can save you.

You’ll record the main details of your character on
a character sheet. Throughout this chapter, we use
the term “character sheet” to mean whatever you
use to track your character’s details, whether it’s a
printed character sheet, a digital character sheet, or
plain paper. Choose whichever style of sheet works
for you, and then embark on creating a character!

Create Your Character

Here are the steps to make a character; each step is
explored in detail:

1: Choose a Class. Every adventurer is a member
of a class. A class broadly describes a character’s
vocation, special talents, and favored tactics.
2: Determine Origin. A character’s origin includes
two elements: background and species. How did
the character spend the years leading up to a life
of adventure? Who are the character’s ancestors?
You can also choose your character’s languages.
3: Determine Ability Scores. Much of what your
character does in the game depends on the character’s six abilities.
4: Choose an Alignment. Alignment is a shorthand
for your character’s moral compass.
5: Fill in Details. Using the choices you’ve made, fill
in the remaining details on your character sheet.

Step 1: Choose Class

Choose a class, and write it on your character sheet.
The Class Overview table summarizes the classes.
See “Classes” for the classes’ details.

Write Your Level
Write your character’s level on your character
sheet. Typically, a character starts at level 1 and
advances in level by adventuring and gaining Experience Points (XP).
Write Your XP. Also record your Experience
Points. A level 1 character has 0 XP.
Starting at a Higher Level. Your GM might start
you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher,
write your chosen subclass on your character sheet.
See the “Starting at Higher Levels” section later in
“Character Creation” for more information.

Note Armor Training

Your class might give you training with certain
categories of armor. Note your armor training on
your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of
armor means you can wear that armor effectively,
gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of
armor are described in “Equipment.”

Step 2: Character Origin

Determining your character’s origin involves choosing a background, a species, and two languages.
A character’s background represents the place
and occupation that were most formative for the
character. The combination of background, species,
and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination as you ponder your character’s earliest days.

Choose a Background

Choose your character’s background, and write it on
your character sheet. You can choose any of the backgrounds detailed in “Character Origins,” and your GM
might offer additional backgrounds as options.
The background you choose influences step 3,
when you determine your character’s ability scores.
If you’re having trouble choosing, the Ability Scores
and Backgrounds table shows which backgrounds
benefit which ability scores. Look for your class’s
primary ability there.

Record Your Feat. A background gives you a feat,
which grants your character particular capabilities.
Feats are detailed in “Feats.” Write the feat on your
character sheet.
Note Proficiencies. Your background gives proficiency in two skills and with one tool. Record this
information on your character sheet.
Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your
class description in “Classes” and note the proficiencies on your character sheet.
The features table in your class description shows
your Proficiency Bonus (described in “Playing the
Game”), which is +2 for a level 1 character. Note this
number on your character sheet. You’ll fill in other
numbers connected to these proficiencies in step 5.

Your character knows at least three languages:
Common plus two languages you roll or choose
from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a
language means your character can communicate in
it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features
might also give you languages.
The Standard Languages table lists languages that
are widespread in the setting. Every player character knows Common. The other standard languages
originated with the first members of the most
prominent species in the setting and have since
spread widely.

the specifics in “Equipment” later. Note any coins

Choose a Species

Choose a species for your character. The following
species options are detailed in “Character Origins”:
Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling,
Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Once you’ve chosen a species, write it on your character sheet. Then record
your species’ traits.
Your character’s size and Speed are determined
by the character’s species; record these in the appropriate places on your character sheet as well
(you may write just the first letter of your size).

Imagine Your Past and Present

Let your character’s background and species inspire
how you imagine their past. That past fed into the
character’s present. With that in mind, consider answers to the following questions as your character:
•
•
•
•
•

Who raised you?
Who was your dearest childhood friend?
Did you grow up with a pet?
Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?
Did you join an organization, such as a guild or religion? If so, are you still a member of it?
• What elements of your past inspire you to go on
adventures now?

Creatures that know one of these dialects can communicate with
those that know a different one.

Step 3: Ability Scores
To determine your character’s ability scores, you
first generate a set of six numbers using the instructions below and then assign them to your six abilities. “Playing the Game” explains what each ability
means.

Generate Your Scores
Determine your ability scores by using one of the
following three methods. Your GM might prefer you
to use a particular one.
Standard Array. Use the following six scores for
your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
Random Generation. Roll four d6s and record
the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more
times, so you have six numbers.
Point Cost. You have 27 points to spend on your
ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on
the Ability Score Point Costs table. For example, a
score of 14 costs 7 of your 27 points.

Ability Score Point Costs

Determine Ability Modifiers

Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the
Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

Assign Ability Scores
Once you’ve generated six scores, assign them to
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class’s
primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.
If you’re using the Standard Array option, consult
the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions
on where to assign scores for your character’s class.
The table puts the highest scores in a class’s main
abilities. If you used a different method to generate the scores, you may still use this table to guide
where you place your highest and lowest scores.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

The Nine Alignments

A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).
The summaries of the alignments below describe
the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment; individuals can vary from that behavior.
Lawful Good (LG). Lawful Good creatures endeavor to do the right thing as expected by society.
Someone who fights injustice and protects the innocent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.
Neutral Good (NG). Neutral Good creatures do the
best they can, working within rules but not feeling
bound by them. A kindly person who helps others
according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.
Chaotic Good (CG). Chaotic Good creatures act as
their conscience directs with little regard for what
others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron’s
tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the
poor is probably Chaotic Good.
Lawful Neutral (LN). Lawful Neutral individuals
act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal
codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of
life—and isn’t swayed either by the demands of
those in need or by the temptations of evil—is probably Lawful Neutral.
Neutral (N). Neutral is the alignment of those who
prefer to avoid moral questions and don’t take sides,

Unaligned Creatures
Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational
thought don’t have alignments; they are unaligned.
Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they
aren’t evil; they are unaligned.

doing what seems best at the time. Someone who’s
bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.
Chaotic Neutral (CN). Chaotic Neutral creatures
follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom
above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land
living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.
Lawful Evil (LE). Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code
of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting citizens while scheming for power is probably
Lawful Evil.
Neutral Evil (NE). Neutral Evil is the alignment of
those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as
they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and
murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.
Chaotic Evil (CE). Chaotic Evil creatures act
with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or
bloodlust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance
and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.

Step 5: Character Creation Details
Now fill in the rest of your character sheet.

Record Class Features

Look at your class’s feature table in “Classes,” and
write down the level 1 features. The class features
are detailed there too.
Some class features offer choices. Make sure to
read all your features and make any offered choices.

Fill In Numbers

22

Note these numbers on your character sheet.
Saving Throws. For the saving throws you have
proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier and note the total. Some
players also like to note the modifier for saving
throws they’re not proficient in, which is just the
relevant ability modifier.
Skills. For skills you have proficiency in, add your
Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated
with that skill, and note the total. You might also
wish to note the modifier for skills you’re not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.
Passive Perception. Sometimes your GM will determine whether your character notices something
without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception)
check; the GM uses your Passive Perception instead.
Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general
awareness of your surroundings when you’re not
actively looking for something. Use this formula to
determine your Passive Perception score:

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Passive Perception = 10 + Wisdom (Perception)
check modifier
Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom
(Perception) checks. For example, if your character
has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Perception skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 +
2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency).
Hit Points. Your class and Constitution modifier
determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1, as
shown on the Level 1 Hit Points by Class table.

Level 1 Hit Points by Class
Class

Hit Point Maximum

Barbarian

12 + Con. modifier

Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger

10 + Con. modifier

Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk,
Rogue, or Warlock

8 + Con. modifier

Sorcerer or Wizard

6 + Con. modifier

The character sheet includes room to note your
current Hit Points when you take damage, as well as
any Temporary Hit Points you might gain. There’s
also space to track Death Saving Throws.
Hit Point Dice. Your class’s description tells you
the die type of your character’s Hit Point Dice (or
Hit Dice for short); write this on your character
sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You
can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover
Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space
to note how many Hit Dice you’ve spent.
Initiative. Write your Dexterity modifier in the
space for Initiative on your character sheet.
Armor Class. Without armor or a shield, your
base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a
Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in
“Equipment.” A class feature might give you a different way to calculate your AC.
Attacks. In the Weapons & Damage Cantrips
section of the character sheet, write your starting
weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with
which you have proficiency is one of the following
unless a weapon’s property says otherwise:
Melee attack bonus = Strength modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
Ranged attack bonus = Dexterity modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus

Look up the damage and properties of your
weapons in “Equipment.” You add the same ability
modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your
damage rolls with that weapon.
Spellcasting. Note both the saving throw DC for
your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you
make with them, using these formulas:

Spell save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
Spell attack bonus = spellcasting ability modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
Your spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is determined by whatever feature gives you the ability
to cast the spell.
Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells. If
your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic
feature, your class features table shows the number
of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips
you know, and how many spells you can prepare.
Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note
them—along with your number of spell slots—on
your character sheet.

Level Advancement

While going on adventures, your character gains experience, represented by Experience Points (XP). A
character who reaches a specified Experience Point
total advances in capability. This advancement is
called gaining a level.
The Character Advancement table lists the XP
you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency
Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP
total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience
Points column, you reach the corresponding level.

Gaining a Level
When you gain a level, follow these steps:

1: Choose a Class. Most characters advance in the
same class. However, you might decide to gain a
level in another class using the rules in the “Multiclassing” section.
2: Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice. Each time
you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die.
Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to
the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your
Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can
use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points
by Class table.

Fixed Hit Points by Class
Class

Hit Points per Level

Barbarian

7 + Con. modifier

Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger

6 + Con. modifier

Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk,
Rogue, or Warlock

5 + Con. modifier

Sorcerer or Wizard

4 + Con. modifier

3: Record New Class Features. Look at your class
features table in “Classes,” and note the features
you gain at your new level in that class. Make any
choices offered by a new feature.
4: Adjust Proficiency Bonus. A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as
shown in the Character Advancement table and
your class features table in “Classes.” When your
Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the
numbers on your character sheet that include
your Proficiency Bonus.
5: Adjust Ability Modifiers. If you choose a feat
that increases one or more of your ability scores,
your ability modifier also changes if the new
score is an even number. When that happens, adjust all the numbers on your character sheet that
use that ability modifier. When your Constitution
modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum
increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
For example, if a character reaches level 8 and
increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18,
the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The
character’s Hit Point maximum then increases by
8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reaching level 8.

Tiers of Play

With each new level, characters acquire new capabilities that equip them to handle greater challenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of
the game also changes, and the stakes of the campaign get higher. It’s helpful to think of a character’s
(and a campaign’s) arc in terms of four tiers of play,

describing the journey from a level 1 character just
beginning an adventuring career to the epic heights
of level 20. These tiers don’t have any rules associated with them; they point to the fact that the play
experience evolves as characters gain levels.

Tier 1 (Levels 1–4)

In tier 1, characters are apprentice adventurers,
though they are already set apart from the broader
populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities.
They learn their starting class features and choose
a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a danger to local farmsteads or villages.

Tier 2 (Levels 5–10)

In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers.
Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as Fireball, Lightning Bolt, and Raise Dead. Most weapon-focused
classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks
in a round. The characters now face dangers that
threaten cities and kingdoms.

Tier 3 (Levels 11–16)

In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power
that makes them special among adventurers. At
level 11, many spell­casters learn reality-altering
spells. Other characters gain features that allow
them to make more attacks or to do more impressive things with those attacks. These adventurers
often confront threats to whole regions.

Tier 4 (Levels 17–20)

At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their
class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The
fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse
might hang in the balance during their adventures.

Starting at Higher Levels

Your GM might start your group’s characters at a
level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended
to start at level 3 if your group is composed of seasoned D&D players.

Creating Your Character

Creating a higher-level character uses the same
character-creation steps outlined in this chapter
and the rules for advancing beyond level 1 provided

Starting Equipment at Higher Levels
Starting Level

24

Bonus Feats at Level 20
A GM can use feats as a form of advancement after
characters reach level 20 to provide greater power
to characters who have no more levels to gain. With
this approach, each character gains one feat of their
choice for every 30,000 XP the character earns
above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially
appropriate for these bonus feats, but a player can
choose any feat for which their level 20 character
qualifies.

in the “Level Advancement” section. You begin with
the minimum amount of XP required to reach your
starting level. For example, if the GM starts you at
level 10, you have 64,000 XP.

Starting Equipment

The GM decides whether your character starts with
more than the standard equipment for a level 1
character, possibly even one or more magic items.
The Starting Equipment at Higher Levels table is a
guide for the GM.
Also, check with your GM about what equipment
is available for you to buy with your starting money.
For example, the firearms described in “Equipment”
are too expensive for level 1 characters, but they
might be available for purchase if your GM allows
them.

Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple
classes. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in
level instead of gaining a level in your current class.
Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes
to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in a single class.

Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of
at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class
and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian
who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must
have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher,

System Reference Document 5.2.1

since Strength is the primary ability for Barbarians
and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.

Experience Points

The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on
your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement
table in “Character Creation.” For example, if you
are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain
enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your
second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a
Cleric.

Hit Points and Hit Point Dice

You gain the Hit Points from your new class as described for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit
Points for a class only when your total character
level is 1.
Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your
classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice
are the same die type, you can pool them together.
For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have
a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5
Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes
give you Hit Dice of different types, track them separately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin,
for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10
Hit Dice.

Proficiency Bonus

Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as
shown in the Character Advancement table. For
example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue,
you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 character, which is +3.

Proficiencies

When you gain your first level in a class other than
your initial class, you gain only some of the new
class’s starting proficiencies, as detailed in each
class’s description in “Classes.”

Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features have additional
rules when you’re multiclassing. Check the information about multiclassing included in each of your
classes’ descriptions.
Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting,
and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give
you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.

Armor Class

If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor
Class, you can benefit from only one at a time.
For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk’s

25

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Unarmored Defense feature and a Sorcerer’s Draconic Resilience feature must choose only one of
those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.

Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than
one class, the features don’t stack. You can’t make
more than two attacks with this feature unless you
have a feature that says you can (such as the Fighter’s Two Extra Attacks feature).
Similarly, the Warlock’s Thirsting Blade invocation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature
with your pact weapon, doesn’t give you additional
attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Spellcasting

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on
your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes
and partly on your individual levels in those classes.
Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more
than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass
but have the Spellcasting feature from only one
class, follow the rules for that class.
Spells Prepared. You determine what spells you
can prepare for each class individually, as if you
were a single-classed member of that class. If you
are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example,
you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you
can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as
well as four Sorcerer cantrips).
Each spell you prepare is associated with one of
your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of
that class when you cast the spell.
Cantrips. If a cantrip of yours increases in power
at higher levels, the increase is based on your total
character level, not your level in a particular class,
unless the spell says otherwise.
Spell Slots. You determine your available spell
slots by adding together the following:
• All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer,
and Wizard classes
• Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and
Ranger classes

Then look up this total level in the Level column of
the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for
that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from
any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.
This table might give you spell slots of a higher
level than the spells you prepare. You can use those
slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a
lower-level spell that you cast, like Burning Hands,
has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level,
you can use the enhanced effect as normal.
For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3
Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when determining your spell slots, counting all your levels
as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown

in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four
level 1 spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3
slots. However, you can’t prepare any level 3 spells,
nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You
can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the
spells you do prepare—and potentially enhance
their effects.
Pact Magic. If you have the Pact Magic feature
from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature,
you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic
to cast spells you have prepared from classes with
the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell
slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast
Warlock spells you have prepared.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.
Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
Rage Damage. When you make an attack using
Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed
Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain
a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain
levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage
column of the Barbarian Features table.
Strength Advantage. You have Advantage on
Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
No Concentration or Spells. You can’t maintain
Concentration, and you can’t cast spells.
Duration. The Rage lasts until the end of your
next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor
or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage
is still active on your next turn, you can extend
the Rage for another round by doing one of the
following:
• Make an attack roll against an enemy.
• Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
• Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end
of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to
10 minutes.

Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain
this benefit.

Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the
mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long
Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one
of those weapon choices.
When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain
the ability to use the mastery properties of more
kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery
column of the Barbarian Features table.

Level 2: Danger Sense

You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as
they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge
perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving
throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.

Level 2: Reckless Attack

You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your
first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next

29

System Reference Document 5.2.1

turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage
during that time.

Level 3: Barbarian Subclass

You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The
Path of the Berserker subclass is detailed after this
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization
that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels.
For the rest of your career, you gain each of your
subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level
or lower.

Level 3: Primal Knowledge

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice
from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.
In addition, while your Rage is active, you can
channel primal power when you attempt certain
tasks; whenever you make an ability check using
one of the following skills, you can make it as a
Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception,
Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your
Strength represents primal power coursing through
you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you
take the Attack action on your turn.

Level 5: Fast Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t
wearing Heavy armor.

Level 7: Feral Instinct

Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.

Level 7: Instinctive Pounce

As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your
Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.

Level 9: Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your
choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t
have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the
target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type
dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can
cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You
have the following effect options.
Forceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet
straight away from you. You can then move up to
half your Speed straight toward the target without
provoking Opportunity Attacks.

Hamstring Blow. The target’s Speed is reduced by
15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can
be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—
the most recent one.

Level 11: Relentless Rage

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous
wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage
is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC
10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your
Hit Points instead change to a number equal to
twice your Barbarian level.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the
DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long
Rest, the DC resets to 10.

Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike

You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The
following effects are now among your Brutal Strike
options.
Staggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on
the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make
Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next
turn.
Sundering Blow. Before the start of your next
turn, the next attack roll made by another creature
against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An
attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.

Level 15: Persistent Rage

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage
in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a
Long Rest.
In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts
for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything
to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends
early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just
the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.

Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to
2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal
Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike
feature.

Level 18: Indomitable Might

If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving
throw is less than your Strength score, you can use
that score in place of the total.

Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Irresistible Offense is recommended.

30

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Level 20: Primal Champion
You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

Barbarian Subclass:
Path of the Berserker
Channel Rage into Violent Fury

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker
direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their
path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in
the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize
and empower them.

Level 3: Frenzy

If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active,
you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on
your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal
to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together.
The damage has the same type as the weapon or
Unarmed Strike used for the attack.

Level 6: Mindless Rage

You have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions while your Rage is active. If you’re
Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage,
the condition ends on you.

Level 10: Retaliation

When you take damage from a creature that is
within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to
make one melee attack against that creature, using
a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.

Level 14: Intimidating Presence

As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others
with your menacing presence and primal power.
When you do so, each creature of your choice in a
30-foot Emanation originating from you must make
a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength
modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save,
a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature’s
turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use
of your Rage (no action required) to restore your
use of it.

have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
Once within the next hour when the creature fails
a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic
Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.
Number of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
At Higher Levels. Your Bardic Inspiration die
changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as
shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at
level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic
arts. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The
information below details how you use those rules
with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list
later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice
from the Bard spell list. Dancing Lights and Vicious
Mockery are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace
one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your
choice from the Bard spell list.
When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn
another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Bard Features table shows how
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to
cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1
spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person, Color
Spray, Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list
matches the number on the table. The chosen spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of

32

System Reference Document 5.2.1

prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and
2 in any combination.
If another Bard feature gives you spells that you
always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Bard spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your
list with another Bard spell for which you have spell
slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

Level 2: Expertise

You gain Expertise (see “Rules Glossary”) in two of
your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance
and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them.
At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of
your skill proficiencies of your choice.

Level 2: Jack of All Trades

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round
down) to any ability check you make that uses a
skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise
use your Proficiency Bonus.
For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics)
check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add
half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

Level 3: Bard Subclass

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College
of Lore subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you
features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your
career, you gain each of your subclass’s features
that are of your Bard level or lower.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8,
12, and 16.

Level 5: Font of Inspiration

You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action
required) to regain one expended use of Bardic
Inspiration.

Level 7: Countercharm
You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature
within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an
effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to
be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.

Bard Subclass:
College of Lore
Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge
Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes,
mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s members gather in libraries and universities to share
their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important
figures of authority.

Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

35

System Reference Document 5.2.1

You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract,
confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see
within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or
succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can
take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic
Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and
subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll,
reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.

Level 6: Magical Discoveries

You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can
come from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list or
any combination thereof (see a class’s section for its
spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a
spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the
Bard Features table.
You always have the chosen spells prepared, and
whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one
of the spells with another spell that meets these
requirements.

Level 14: Peerless Skill

When you make an ability check or attack roll and
fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration;
roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number
rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into
a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t
expended.

Cleric

System Reference Document 5.2.1

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn
another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list
of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast
with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells
from the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding
Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your
list matches the number on the table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1
and 2 in any combination.
If another Cleric feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Cleric spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with
other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your Cleric spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as
a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

Level 1: Divine Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following
sacred roles of your choice.
Protector. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency
with Martial weapons and training with Heavy
armor.
Thaumaturge. You know one extra cantrip from
the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your
Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus
equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

Level 2: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the
Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with
two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead,
each of which is described below. Each time you use
this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel
Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.

37

System Reference Document 5.2.1

You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice.
You regain one of its expended uses when you finish
a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses
when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in
the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features
table.
If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving
throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this
class’s Spellcasting feature.
Divine Spark. As a Magic action, you point your
Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within
30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it.
Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either
restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total
or force the creature to make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic
or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as
much damage (round down).
You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric
levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).
Turn Undead. As a Magic action, you present your
Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each
Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails
its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated
conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries
to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This
effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if
you die.

Level 3: Cleric Subclass

You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life
Domain subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of
your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8,
12, and 16.

Level 5: Sear Undead

Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a
number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier
(minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each
Undead that fails its saving throw against that use
of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the
roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.

Level 7: Blessed Strikes

Cantrips (Level 0 Cleric Spells)

Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of
the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book,
use only the option you choose for this feature).
Divine Strike. Once on each of your turns when
you hit a creature with an attack roll using a
weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra
1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).
Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier
to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.

Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a

that spell without expending a spell slot or needing
Material components. You can’t use this feature

Level 9 Cleric Spells

Cleric Subclass: Life Domain
Soothe the Hurts of the World
The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that
helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who
tap into this domain are masters of healing, using
that life force to cure many hurts.
Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any
religious tradition might choose it. This domain is
particularly associated with agricultural deities,
gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and
community. Religious orders of healing also seek
the magic of this domain.

Level 3: Disciple of Life

When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit
Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The
additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s
level.

40

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you
always have certain spells ready. When you reach
a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells
table, you thereafter always have the listed spells
prepared.

Level 3: Preserve Life
As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol
and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke
healing energy that can restore a number of Hit
Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose
Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which
can include you), and divide those Hit Points among
them. This feature can restore a creature to no
more than half its Hit Point maximum.

Level 6: Blessed Healer

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as
well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell
slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points
equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.

Level 17: Supreme Healing

When you would normally roll one or more dice to
restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die.
For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a
creature with a spell, you restore 12.

how you use those rules with Druid spells, which
appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s
description.
Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice
from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce
Flame are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace
one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your
choice from the Druid spell list.
When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn
another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to
cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1
spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship,
Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Druid spell list until the number of spells on your
list matches the number on the table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1
and 2 in any combination.
If another Druid feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Druid spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other
Druid spells for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your Druid spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

Level 1: Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids.
While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals;
you always have the Speak with Animals spell
prepared.
You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You
and others who know Druidic automatically spot
such a message. Others spot the message’s presence

with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
check but can’t decipher it without magic.

Level 1: Primal Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following
sacred roles of your choice.
Magician. You know one extra cantrip from the
Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence
(Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your
Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).
Warden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency
with Martial weapons and training with Medium
armor.

Level 2: Wild Shape

The power of nature allows you to assume the form
of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into
a Beast form that you have learned for this feature
(see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form
for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level
or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form
early as a Bonus Action.
Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice.
You regain one expended use when you finish a
Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a Long Rest.
You gain additional uses when you reach certain
Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of
the Druid Features table.
Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this
feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that
have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that
lack a Fly Speed (see “Animals” in “Monsters” for
stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider,
and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a
Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms
with another eligible form.
When you reach certain Druid levels, your number
of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating
for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast
Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can
adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.
When choosing known forms, you may look in
other sources for eligible Beasts if the Game Master
permits you to do so.

Points equal to your Druid level.
Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced
by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features;
languages; and feats. You also retain your skill
and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the
proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving
throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher
than yours, use the one in the stat block.
No Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shapeshifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.
Objects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own.
In addition, you choose whether your equipment
falls in your space, merges into your new form, or
is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it’s practical for
the new form to wear a piece of equipment based
on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment
doesn’t change size or shape to match the new
form, and any equipment that the new form can’t
wear must either fall to the ground or merge with
the form. Equipment that merges with the form
has no effect while you’re in that form.

Level 2: Wild Companion

You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an
animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can
expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the
Find Familiar spell without Material components.
When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is
Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.

Level 3: Druid Subclass

You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle
of the Land subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of
your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Druid level or lower.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8,
12, and 16.

43

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Level 5: Wild Resurgence
Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of
Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).
In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape
(no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell
slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a Long
Rest.

Level 7: Elemental Fury

The might of the elements flows through you. You
gain one of the following options of your choice.
Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier
to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.
Primal Strike. Once on each of your turns when
you hit a creature with an attack roll using a
weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you
can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire,
Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you
hit).

Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury

The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows
more powerful, as detailed below.
Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s
range increases by 300 feet.
Primal Strike. The extra damage of your Primal
Strike increases to 2d8.

Level 18: Beast Spells

While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast
form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its
Material component.

Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.

Level 20: Archdruid

The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you,
granting you the following benefits.
Evergreen Wild Shape. Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain
one expended use of it.
Nature Magician. You can convert uses of Wild
Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose
a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape
and convert them into a single spell slot, with each
use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you
convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level
4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do
so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Longevity. The primal magic that you wield
causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years
that pass, your body ages only one year.

Druid Subclass:
Circle of the Land
Celebrate Connection to the Natural World
The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages
who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These
Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The
circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests
of their communities.

Level 3: Circle of the Land Spells

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one type
of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. Consult

Level 3: Land’s Aid
As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild
Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself.
Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns
appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in
the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw
against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic
damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
a successful one. One creature of your choice in that
area regains 2d6 Hit Points.
The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when
you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).

Level 6: Natural Recovery

You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have
prepared from your Circle Spells feature without
expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long
Rest before you do so again.
In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can
choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell
slots can have a combined level that is equal to or
less than half your Druid level (round up), and none
of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level
6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of
spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level
2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots.
Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you
can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

Level 10: Nature’s Ward

You are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you
have Resistance to a damage type associated with
your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature,
as shown in the Nature’s Ward table.

Level 14: Nature’s Sanctuary
As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild
Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear
in a 15-foot Cube on the ground within 120 feet of
yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you
have the Incapacitated condition or die. You and
your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and
your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature’s Ward while there.
As a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to
60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.

Level 1: Second Wind

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You have a limited well of physical and mental
stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action,
you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10
plus your Fighter level.
You can use this feature twice. You regain one
expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you
regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
Rest.
When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain
more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second
Wind column of the Fighter Features table.

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Fighter levels
6, 8, 12, 14, and 16.

Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the
mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish

the ability to use the mastery properties of more
kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery
column of the Fighter Features table.

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits
for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the Magic action.

until you finish a Short or Long Rest. Starting at
level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only
once on a turn.

Level 2: Tactical Mind

You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend
a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward
success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll
1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check,
potentially turning it into a success. If the check still
fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.

Level 3: Fighter Subclass

You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The
Champion subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest
of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Fighter level or lower.

48

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Level 5: Extra Attack

take the Attack action on your turn.

Level 5: Tactical Shift

Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a
Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed
without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

Level 9: Indomitable

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a
bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the
new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until
you finish a Long Rest.
You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest
starting at level 13 and three times before a Long
Rest starting at level 17.

Level 9: Tactical Master

When you attack with a weapon whose mastery
property you can use, you can replace that property
with the Push, Sap, or Slow property for that attack.

Level 11: Two Extra Attacks

You can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Level 13: Studied Attacks

You study your opponents and learn from each attack you make. If you make an attack roll against a
creature and miss, you have Advantage on your next
attack roll against that creature before the end of
your next turn.

Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Combat Prowess is recommended.

Level 20: Three Extra Attacks

You can attack four times instead of once whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

Fighter Subclass: Champion
Pursue Physical Excellence in Combat
A Champion focuses on the development of martial
prowess in a relentless pursuit of victory. Champions combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows, withstand peril,
and garner glory. Whether in athletic contests or
bloody battle, Champions strive for the crown of the
victor.

Level 3: Improved Critical

Your attack rolls with weapons and Unarmed
Strikes can score a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20
on the d20.

Level 3: Remarkable Athlete

Thanks to your athleticism, you have Advantage on
Initiative rolls and Strength (Athletics) checks.
In addition, immediately after you score a Critical
Hit, you can move up to half your Speed without
provoking Opportunity Attacks.

The thrill of battle drives you toward victory.

Strikes can now score a Critical Hit on a roll of
18–20 on the d20.

Level 18: Survivor

You attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle, giving
you these benefits.
Defy Death. You have Advantage on Death Saving
Throws. Moreover, when you roll 18–20 on a Death
Saving Throw, you gain the benefit of rolling a 20 on
it.
Heroic Rally. At the start of each of your turns,
you regain Hit Points equal to 5 plus your Constitution modifier if you are Bloodied and have at least 1
Hit Point.

Level 1: Martial Arts

Level 1: Unarmored Defense

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of
combat styles that use your Unarmed Strike and
Monk weapons, which are the following:

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a
Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your
Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.

• Simple Melee weapons
• Martial Melee weapons that have the Light
property

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield.
Bonus Unarmed Strike. You can make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.
Martial Arts Die. You can roll 1d6 in place of the
normal damage of your Unarmed Strike or Monk
weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels,
as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk
Features table.
Dexterous Attacks. You can use your Dexterity
modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the
attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes
and Monk weapons. In addition, when you use the
Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike,
you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your
Strength modifier to determine the save DC.

Martial
Arts

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Level 2: Monk’s Focus

Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself.
This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your
Monk level determines the number of points you
have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the
Monk Features table.
You can expend these points to enhance or fuel
certain Monk features. You start knowing three
such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and
Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.
When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable
until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of
which you regain all your expended points.
Some features that use Focus Points require your
target to make a saving throw. The save DC equals 8
plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.
Flurry of Blows. You can expend 1 Focus Point to
make two Unarmed Strikes as a Bonus Action.
Patient Defense. You can take the Disengage
action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can

expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage
and the Dodge actions as a Bonus Action.
Step of the Wind. You can take the Dash action
as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1
Focus Point to take both the Disengage and Dash
actions as a Bonus Action, and your jump distance is
doubled for the turn.

Level 2: Unarmored Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t
wearing armor or wielding a Shield. This bonus
increases when you reach certain Monk levels, as
shown on the Monk Features table.

Level 2: Uncanny Metabolism

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended Focus Points. When you do so, roll your
Martial Arts die, and regain a number of Hit Points
equal to your Monk level plus the number rolled.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest.

Level 3: Deflect Attacks

When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage,
you can take a Reaction to reduce the attack’s total
damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10 plus
your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.
If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1
Focus Point to redirect some of the attack’s force.
If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5
feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a
creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that
isn’t behind Total Cover if the attack was a ranged
attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of
your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier.
The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.

Level 3: Monk Subclass

You gain a Monk subclass of your choice. The Warrior of the Open Hand subclass is detailed after this
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization
that grants you features at certain Monk levels. For
the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Monk level or lower.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you

51

System Reference Document 5.2.1

qualify. You gain this feature again at Monk levels 8,
12, and 16.

Level 4: Slow Fall

You can take a Reaction when you fall to reduce any
damage you take from the fall by an amount equal
to five times your Monk level.

Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you
take the Attack action on your turn.

Level 5: Stunning Strike

Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk
weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 1
Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the target has the Stunned condition until the
start of your next turn. On a successful save, the
target’s Speed is halved until the start of your next
turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before then has Advantage.

Level 6: Empowered Strikes

Whenever you deal damage with your Unarmed
Strike, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its
normal damage type.

Level 7: Evasion

When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you
to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half
damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed
on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.
You don’t benefit from this feature if you have the
Incapacitated condition.

Level 9: Acrobatic Movement

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a
Shield, you gain the ability to move along vertical
surfaces and across liquids on your turn without
falling during the movement.

Level 10: Heightened Focus

Your Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of
the Wind gain the following benefits.
Flurry of Blows. You can expend 1 Focus Point
to use Flurry of Blows and make three Unarmed
Strikes with it instead of two.

Patient Defense. When you expend a Focus Point
to use Patient Defense, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to two rolls of your Martial
Arts die.
Step of the Wind. When you expend a Focus Point
to use Step of the Wind, you can choose a willing
creature within 5 feet of yourself that is Large or
smaller. You move the creature with you until the
end of your turn. The creature’s movement doesn’t
provoke Opportunity Attacks.

Level 10: Self-Restoration

Through sheer force of will, you can remove one
of the following conditions from yourself at the
end of each of your turns: Charmed, Frightened, or
Poisoned.
In addition, forgoing food and drink doesn’t give
you levels of Exhaustion.

Level 13: Deflect Energy

You can now use your Deflect Attacks feature
against attacks that deal any damage type, not just
Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.

Level 14: Disciplined Survivor

Your physical and mental discipline grant you proficiency in all saving throws.
Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw
and fail, you can expend 1 Focus Point to reroll it,
and you must use the new roll.

Level 15: Perfect Focus

When you roll Initiative and don’t use Uncanny Metabolism, you regain expended Focus Points until
you have 4 if you have 3 or fewer.

Level 18: Superior Defense

At the start of your turn, you can expend 3 Focus
Points to bolster yourself against harm for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition.
During that time, you have Resistance to all damage
except Force damage.

Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Irresistible Offense is recommended.

Level 20: Body and Mind

You have developed your body and mind to new
heights. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores increase
by 4, to a maximum of 25.

52

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Monk Subclass: Warrior of the
Open Hand
Master Unarmed Combat Techniques
Warriors of the Open Hand are masters of unarmed
combat. They learn techniques to push and trip
their opponents and manipulate their own energy
to protect themselves from harm.

Level 3: Open Hand Technique

Whenever you hit a creature with an attack granted
by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the
following effects on that target.
Addle. The target can’t make Opportunity Attacks
until the start of its next turn.
Push. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.
Topple. The target must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw or have the Prone condition.

Level 6: Wholeness of Body

You gain the ability to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can roll your Martial Arts die. You regain
a number of Hit Points equal to the number rolled
plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point
regained).
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and
you regain all expended uses when you finish a
Long Rest.

Level 11: Fleet Step

When you take a Bonus Action other than Step of
the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind immediately after that Bonus Action.

Level 17: Quivering Palm

You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in
someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an
Unarmed Strike, you can expend 4 Focus Points
to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last
for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The
vibrations are harmless unless you take an action
to end them. Alternatively, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of the
attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and
the target must be on the same plane of existence.
When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on
a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
one.
You can have only one creature under the effect
of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations
harmlessly (no action required).

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature
(which could be yourself) and draw power from the
pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to
that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.
You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of
healing power to remove the Poisoned condition
from the creature; those points don’t also restore
Hit Points to the creature.

Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and
meditation. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use
those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the
Paladin spell list later in the class’s description.
Spell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to
cast with this feature. To start, choose two level
1 Paladin spells. Heroism and Searing Smite are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as
you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared
Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
Paladin spells until the number of spells on your
list matches the number in the Paladin Features
table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5
Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six
Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
If another Paladin feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Paladin spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your
list with another Paladin spell for which you have
spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as
a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.

Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the
mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your
choice with which you have proficiency, such as
Longswords and Javelins.

54

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change
the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you
could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

Level 2: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see
“Feats” for feats). Instead of choosing one of those
feats, you can choose the option below.
Blessed Warrior. You learn two Cleric cantrips of
your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a list
of Cleric spells). Guidance and Sacred Flame are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin
spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting
ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level,
you can replace one of these cantrips with another
Cleric cantrip.

Level 2: Paladin’s Smite

You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In
addition, you can cast it without expending a spell
slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can
cast it in this way again.

Level 3: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the
Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You
start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is
described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time
you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose
which effect from this class to create.
You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice.
You regain one of its expended uses when you finish
a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use
when you reach Paladin level 11.

Breaking Your Oath

A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of
conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible.
Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.
A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks
absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.
If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath,
talk to your GM. Your Paladin should probably take a
more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class
and adopt another one.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving
throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this
class’s Spellcasting feature.
Divine Sense. As a Bonus Action, you can open
your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and
Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have
the Incapacitated condition, you know the location
of any creature of those types within 60 feet of
yourself, and you know its creature type. Within
the same radius, you also detect the presence of any
place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.

Level 3: Paladin Subclass

You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath
of Devotion subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest
of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels
8, 12, and 16.

Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you
take the Attack action on your turn.

Level 5: Faithful Steed

You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You
always have the Find Steed spell prepared.
You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so
when you finish a Long Rest.

Level 6: Aura of Protection

You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot
Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition.
You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to
saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier
(minimum bonus of +1).
If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the
creature chooses which aura while in them.

55

Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the
Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes
any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target
can do only one of the following on its turns: move,
take an action, or take a Bonus Action.

Level 10: Aura of Courage

You and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If
a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has
no effect on that ally while there.

Level 11: Radiant Strikes

Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When
you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee
weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an
extra 1d8 Radiant damage.

Level 14: Restoring Touch

When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can
also remove one or more of the following conditions
from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened,
Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On
Hands for each of these conditions you remove;
those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the
creature.

Level 18: Aura Expansion

Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation.

Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Truesight is recommended.

The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals
of justice and order. These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold
themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and
some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the
world to the same standards.
Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods
of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the
measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as
their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings
into their helmets or coats of arms.

Level 3: Sacred Weapon
When you take the Attack action, you can expend
one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one
Melee weapon that you are holding with positive
energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature
again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack
rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus
of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to
deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.
The weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot
radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.
You can end this effect early (no action required).
This effect also ends if you aren’t carrying the
weapon.

Level 7: Aura of Devotion

You and your allies have Immunity to the Charmed
condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a
Charmed ally enters the aura, that condition has no
effect on that ally while there.

Level 15: Smite of Protection
Your magical smite now radiates protective energy.
Whenever you cast Divine Smite, you and your allies
have Half Cover while in your Aura of Protection.
The aura has this benefit until the start of your next
turn.

Level 20: Holy Nimbus

As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with holy power, granting the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action
required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot
(no action required).
Holy Ward. You have Advantage on any saving
throw you are forced to make by a Fiend or an
Undead.
Radiant Damage. Whenever an enemy starts its
turn in the aura, that creature takes Radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus.

is sunlight.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to
cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1
Ranger spells. Cure Wounds and Ensnaring Strike are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional Ranger spells
until the number of spells on your list matches the
number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your
list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells
of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
If another Ranger feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count

You can call on the forces of nature to reveal certain

damage to the target if it’s missing any of its Hit
Points. You can deal this extra damage only once
per turn.
Horde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when
you make an attack with a weapon, you can make

uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage’s type is the same as the weapon’s type.
You don’t need Advantage on the attack roll if at
least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target,
the ally doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition,
and you don’t have Disadvantage on the attack roll.
The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue
levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the
Rogue Features table.

Level 1: Thieves’ Cant

You picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You
know Thieves’ Cant and one other language of your
choice, which you choose from the language tables
in “Character Creation.”

Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the
mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your
choice with which you have proficiency, such as
Daggers and Shortbows.

62

Sneak Attack

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change
the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you
could switch to using the mastery properties of
Scimitars and Shortswords.

Level 2: Cunning Action

Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move
and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of
the following actions as a Bonus Action: Dash, Disengage, or Hide.

Level 3: Rogue Subclass

You gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. The Thief
subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A
subclass is a specialization that grants you features
at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career,
you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of
your Rogue level or lower.

Level 3: Steady Aim

As a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage on
your next attack roll on the current turn. You can
use this feature only if you haven’t moved during
this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until
the end of the current turn.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

Level 7: Reliable Talent

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Rogue levels
8, 10, 12, and 16.

Whenever you make an ability check that uses one
of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a
d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

Level 5: Cunning Strike

You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak
Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you
can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects.
Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of
Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the
effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the
effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage
is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect,
remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before
rolling.
If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw,
the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and
Proficiency Bonus.
Poison (Cost: 1d6). You add a toxin to your strike,
forcing the target to make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned
condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its
turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending
the effect on itself on a success.
To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner’s Kit
on your person.
Trip (Cost: 1d6). If the target is Large or smaller,
it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have
the Prone condition.
Withdraw (Cost: 1d6). Immediately after the
attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

Level 5: Uncanny Dodge

When an attacker that you can see hits you with an
attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you (round down).

Level 7: Evasion

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows
you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only
half damage, you instead take no damage if you
succeed on the saving throw and only half damage
if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the
Incapacitated condition.

63

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike

You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when
you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost
for each effect.

Level 14: Devious Strikes

You’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack
deviously. The following effects are now among
your Cunning Strike options.
Daze (Cost: 2d6). The target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can
do only one of the following: move or take an action
or a Bonus Action.
Knock Out (Cost: 6d6). The target must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any
damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.
Obscure (Cost: 3d6). The target must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.

Level 15: Slippery Mind

Your cunning mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma
saving throws.

Level 18: Elusive

You’re so evasive that attackers rarely gain the
upper hand against you. No attack roll can have
Advantage against you unless you have the Incapacitated condition.

Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the
Night Spirit is recommended.

Level 20: Stroke of Luck

You have a marvelous knack for succeeding when
you need to. If you fail a D20 Test, you can turn the
roll into a 20.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

Rogue Subclass: Thief
Hunt for Treasure as a Classic Adventurer
A mix of burglar, treasure hunter, and explorer, you
are the epitome of an adventurer. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you gain abilities
useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum
benefit from the magic items you find there.

Level 3: Fast Hands

As a Bonus Action, you can do one of the following.
Sleight of Hand. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of
Hand) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with
Thieves’ Tools or to pick a pocket.
Use an Object. Take the Utilize action, or take the
Magic action to use a magic item that requires that
action.

Level 3: Second-Story Work

You’ve trained to get into especially hard-to-reach
places, granting you these benefits.
Climber. You gain a Climb Speed equal to your
Speed.
Jumper. You can determine your jump distance
using your Dexterity rather than your Strength.

Level 9: Supreme Sneak

You gain the following Cunning Strike option.
Stealth Attack (Cost: 1d6). If you have the Hide
action’s Invisible condition, this attack doesn’t end
that condition on you if you end the turn behind
Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover.

Level 13: Use Magic Device

You’ve learned how to maximize use of magic items,
granting you the following benefits.
Attunement. You can attune to up to four magic
items at once.
Charges. Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of
6, you use the property without expending the
charges.
Scrolls. You can use any Spell Scroll, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the
spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you
must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check
(DC 10 plus the spell’s level). On a successful check,
you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check,
the scroll disintegrates.

Level 17: Thief’s Reflexes

You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the
first round of any combat. You take your first turn
at your normal Initiative and your second turn at
your Initiative minus 10.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list
of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast
with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. Burning Hands and Detect Magic are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as
you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared
Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your
list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features
table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3
Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six
Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count

System Reference Document 5.2.1

against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Sorcerer spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on
your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you
have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

Level 1: Innate Sorcery

An event in your past left an indelible mark on you,
infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus
Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute,
during which you gain the following benefits:

• The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells
increases by 1.
• You have Advantage on the attack rolls of
Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all
expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

Level 2: Font of Magic

You can tap into the wellspring of magic within
yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery
Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.
You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as
you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery
Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You
can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number
shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.
You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as
Metamagic, that use those points.
Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points. You
can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery
Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required).
Creating Spell Slots. As a Bonus Action, you can
transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell
slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost
of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists
the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create
a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than
level 5.
Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.

cast. To use an option, you must spend the number
of Sorcery Points that it costs.
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell
when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of
those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you
don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer
level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.

Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass

You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The
Draconic Sorcery subclass is detailed after this
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization
that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels.
For the rest of your career, you gain each of your
subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or
lower.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.

Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration

When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number
equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once
you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you
finish a Long Rest.

Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate

If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can
use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take

In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is
active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast.

Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.

Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis

While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can
use one Metamagic option on each of your turns
without spending Sorcery Points on it.

Metamagic Options

The following options are available to your Meta­
magic feature. The options are presented in alphabetical order.

Careful Spell

Cost: 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures
to make a saving throw, you can protect some of
those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so,
spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those
creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of one creature). A chosen creature automatically
succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and

it takes no damage if it would normally take half
damage on a successful save.

Distant Spell

Cost: 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5
feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the
spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a
range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to
make the spell’s range 30 feet.

Empowered Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1
Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice
up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one),
and you must use the new rolls.
You can use Empowered Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the
casting of the spell.

Extended Spell

Cost: 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
If the affected spell requires Concentration, you
have Advantage on any saving throw you make to
maintain that Concentration.

Heightened Spell
Cost: 2 Sorcery Points

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make
a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to
give one target of the spell Disadvantage on saves
against the spell.

Quickened Spell

Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery
Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that
are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell.

Transmuted Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage
from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery
Point to change that damage type to one of the
other listed types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder.

Twinned Spell

Cost: 1 Sorcery Point

When you cast a spell, such as Charm Person, that
can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an
additional creature, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point
to increase the spell’s effective level by 1.

Sorcerer Spell List

This section presents the Sorcerer spell list. The
spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed.
In the Special column, C means the spell requires
Concentration, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it

Level 8 Sorcerer Spells

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon.
Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed
some of its magical power to you or your ancestor.
You might have absorbed magic from a site infused
with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a
treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was
steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a
dragon for an ancestor.

Level 3: Draconic Resilience

The magic in your body manifests physical traits
of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you
gain another Sorcerer level.
Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like
scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base
Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

Level 3: Draconic Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the
Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have
the listed spells prepared.

Level 6: Elemental Affinity
Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage
type associated with dragons. Choose one of those
types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.
You have Resistance to that damage type, and
when you cast a spell that deals damage of that
type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one
damage roll of that spell.

Level 14: Dragon Wings

As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to
appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or
until you dismiss them (no action required). For the
duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use
of it.

Level 18: Dragon Companion

You can cast Summon Dragon without a Material
component. You can also cast it once without a spell
slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way
when you finish a Long Rest.
Whenever you start casting the spell, you can
modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If
you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for
that casting.

Options” section later in this class’s description.
Prerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For

qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.
When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain
more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.
You can’t pick the same invocation more than once
unless its description says otherwise.

Level 1: Pact Magic

Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact
with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers.
The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity
unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability
to cast spells. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use
those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the
Warlock spell list later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your
choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you
can replace one of your cantrips from this feature
with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.
When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you
learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as
shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.

Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock
spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level
of those slots, all of which are the same level. You
regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you
finish a Short or Long Rest.
For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you
have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell
Charm Person, you must spend one of those slots,
and you cast it as a level 3 spell.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you
to cast with this feature. To start, choose two
level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever
that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list
matches the number in the table. The chosen spells
must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in
the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When
you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.
If another Warlock feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count

against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Warlock spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on
your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible
level.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting
ability for your Warlock spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

Level 2: Magical Cunning

You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At
the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell
slots but no more than a number equal to half your
maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you
can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

Level 3: Warlock Subclass

You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The
Fiend Patron subclass is detailed after this class’s
description. A subclass is a specialization that
grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For
the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or
lower.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels
8, 12, and 16.

Level 9: Contact Patron

In the past, you usually contacted your patron
through intermediaries. Now you can communicate
directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane
spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the
spell without expending a spell slot to contact your
patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s
saving throw.
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t
do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.

Level 11: Mystic Arcanum

Your patron grants you a magical secret called an
arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this
arcanum.
You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest
before you can cast it in this way again.
As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain
another Warlock spell of your choice that can be
cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels
13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9
spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum
when you finish a Long Rest.

72

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.

Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Fate is recommended.

Level 20: Eldritch Master

When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you
regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

connection, extending the duration until the end
of your next turn. The connection ends if you don’t
maintain it in this way.
While perceiving through the other creature’s
senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you can cast spells as if
you were in your space or the other creature’s space
if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other.

Gift of the Depths

Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock

You can breathe underwater, and you gain a Swim

reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, the

73

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Resistance. When the familiar takes damage, you
can take a Reaction to grant it Resistance against
that damage.

you can cast Invisibility on yourself without expending a spell slot.

Otherworldly Leap

Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock

You can cast Jump on yourself without expending a
spell slot.

Pact of the Blade

As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon
in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of
your choice with which you bond—or create a bond
with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with
a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or
another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond
ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and
you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.
Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon,
you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack
and damage rolls instead of using Strength or
Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal
Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal
damage type.
Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this
feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more
than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or
if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the
bond ends.

Pact of the Chain

You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a
Magic action without expending a spell slot.
When you cast the spell, you choose one of the
normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: Imp, Pseudodragon, Quasit,
Skeleton, Sphinx of Wonder, Sprite, or Venomous
Snake (see “Monsters” for the familiar’s stat block).
Additionally, when you take the Attack action,
you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow
your familiar to make one attack of its own with its
Reaction.

Pact of the Tome

Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure
forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or
Long Rest. This Book of Shadows (you determine its
appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you
can access, granting you the benefits below. The

74

System Reference Document 5.2.1

book disappears if you conjure another book with
this feature or if you die.
Cantrips and Rituals. When the book appears,
choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells
that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any
class’s spell list, and they must be spells you don’t
already have prepared. While the book is on your
person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and
they function as Warlock spells for you.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use the book as a
Spellcasting Focus.

Repelling Blast

Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip
That Deals Damage via an Attack Roll

smaller creature with that cantrip, you can push the

Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more
than once. Each time you do so, choose a different
eligible cantrip.

Thirsting Blade

Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade
Invocation

You gain the Extra Attack feature for your pact
weapon only. With that feature, you can attack
twice with the weapon instead of once when you
take the Attack action on your turn.

Visions of Distant Realms
Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock

You can cast Arcane Eye without expending a spell
slot.

Whispers of the Grave

Prerequisite: Level 7+ Warlock

You can cast Speak with Dead without expending a
spell slot.

Warlock Subclass: Fiend Patron
Make a Deal with the Lower Planes
Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of
perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon
lord, an archdevil, or another fiend that is especially
mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption
or destruction of all things, ultimately including
you—and your path is defined by the extent to
which you strive against those aims.

Level 3: Dark One’s Blessing

When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain
Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 Temporary Hit Point). You also gain this benefit if someone
else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 Hit
Points.

Level 3: Fiend Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have
certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock
level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

76

Warlock Level Spells

System Reference Document 5.2.1

You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate
in your favor. When you make an ability check or a
saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10
to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but
before any of the roll’s effects occur.
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but
you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain
all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

Level 10: Fiendish Resilience

Choose one damage type, other than Force, whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest. You have Resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.

Level 14: Hurl Through Hell

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an
attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the
target through the Lower Planes. The target must
succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your
spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles
through a nightmare landscape. The target takes
8d10 Psychic damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the
Incapacitated condition until the end of your next
turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a
Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore
your use of it.

When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn
another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in
the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.
Spellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your
spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds,
contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or
someone casting Identify. You determine the book’s
appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome
or a collection of vellum bound with twine.
The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It
starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice.
Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Sleep, and Thunderwave are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two
Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each
of these spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table.
The spells are the culmination of arcane research
you do regularly.
Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list
of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast
with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from
your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional Wizard spells
until the number of spells on your list matches the
number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots. For example, if
you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells
can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.
If another Wizard feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Wizard spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with
spells from your spellbook.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus
or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your
Wizard spells.

Level 1: Ritual Adept

You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has
the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You

78

System Reference Document 5.2.1

needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read
from the book to cast a spell in this way.

Level 1: Arcane Recovery

You can regain some of your magical energy by
studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short
Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level
equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round
up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher.
For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell
slots.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again
until you finish a Long Rest.

Level 2: Scholar

While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following
skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion.
You have Expertise in the chosen skill.

Level 3: Wizard Subclass

You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The
Evoker subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest

Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook

The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain
levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you
might find other spells during your adventures that
you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy
it into your spellbook.
Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find
a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your
spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you
have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the
transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells
in your spellbook.
Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from
your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since
you already know how to cast the spell. You need
spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the
copied spell.
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same
procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you
have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the
remainder of the new book requires you to find new
spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a
backup spellbook.

of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Wizard level or lower.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels
8, 12, and 16.

Level 5: Memorize Spell

Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study
your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting
feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.

Level 18: Spell Mastery

You have achieved such mastery over certain spells
that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and
a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting
time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level
without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at
a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study
your spellbook and replace one of those spells with
an eligible spell of the same level from the book.

Level 3: Potent Cantrip

Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that
avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll
or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the
cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage
(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the
cantrip.

Wizard Subclass: Evoker
Create Explosive Elemental Effects
Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful
elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame,
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning
acid. Some Evokers find employment in military
forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from
afar. Others use their power to protect others, while
some seek their own gain.

82

Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation
school, each of which must be no higher than level 2,
and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new
level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for
which you have spell slots.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

You can create pockets of relative safety within the
effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can
see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1
plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the
spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

Level 10: Empowered Evocation

Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evocation school, you can add your Intelligence modifier
to one damage roll of that spell.

Level 14: Overchannel

You can increase the power of your spells. When
you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5
that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage
with that spell on the turn you cast it.
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a
Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each
level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it.
This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.
Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level
increases by 1d12.

Character Species
When you choose your character’s species, you
determine whether your character is a human or a
member of a fantastical species, such as dragonborn
or gnome.
The peoples of the multiverse hail from different
worlds and include many kinds of sapient life forms.
A player character’s species is the set of game traits
that an adventurer gains from being one of those
life forms.
Some species can trace their origin to a single
world, plane of existence, or god, while other species first appeared in multiple realms at once.
Whatever a species’ genesis, its members have
spread across the multiverse and contribute to
many different cultures.
Members of most species live for about 80 years,
with exceptions noted in the text about the species in “Character Origins.” Regardless of life span,
members of all species reach physical maturity at
about the same age. Your character can be any age
that isn’t beyond their species’ normal life span.

Parts of a Species

A species includes the following parts.

Creature Type

A character’s species determines the character’s
creature type, which is described in “Rules Glossary.” Every species in “Character Origins” is Humanoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear in
other books.

Size

Your character’s species determines the character’s
size. Individuals within a species cover a wide range
of heights, and some species include such diversity

of size that you can choose whether your character
is Small or Medium.

Speed

Your character’s species determines the character’s
Speed.

Special Traits

Each species gives a character special traits—
unique characteristics based on the species’ physiology or magical nature. When you choose a species,
your character gets all the special traits listed for it.
Some traits involve making a choice from a handful
of options.

Species Descriptions

area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus
your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus).
On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of
the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry
trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as
much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when
you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and

Equipment
Coins
Characters often find coins on their adventures
and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other
businesses. Coins come in different denominations
based on the relative worth of their material. The
Coin Values table lists coins and how much they’re
worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game’s
main coin. For example, 100 Copper Pieces are
worth 1 Gold Piece.
A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty
coins weigh a pound.

Weapons
The Weapons table in this section shows the game’s
main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of
each weapon, as well as the following details:

Category. Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually
tied to one of these categories. For example, you
might have proficiency with Simple weapons.
Melee or Ranged. A weapon is classified as either
Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged
weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
Damage. The table lists the amount of damage a
weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well
as the type of that damage.
Properties. Any properties a weapon has are listed
in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the “Properties” section.
Mastery. Each weapon has a mastery property,
which is defined in the “Mastery Properties” section. To use that property, you must have a feature
that lets you use it.

Selling Equipment

Equipment fetches half its cost when sold. In contrast, trade goods and valuables—like gems and art
objects—retain their full value in the marketplace.
“Magic Items” has prices for magic items.

89

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Weapon Proficiency
Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have
proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to
an attack roll you make with it. A player character’s
features can provide weapon proficiencies. A monster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.

Properties

Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.

Ammunition

You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition
property to make a ranged attack only if you have
ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition
required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each
attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing
the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a
free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a
fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the
ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the
rest is lost.

Finesse

When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use
your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier
for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the
same modifier for both rolls.

Heavy

You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy
weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength
score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and
your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.

Light

When you take the Attack action on your turn and
attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra
attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn.
That extra attack must be made with a different
Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a
Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other
using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you
don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the
damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

Loading

Cleave

You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a
Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus
Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the
number of attacks you can normally make.

If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using
this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with
the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet
of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit,
the second creature takes the weapon’s damage,
but don’t add your ability modifier to that damage
unless that modifier is negative. You can make this
extra attack only once per turn.

Range

A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after
the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range
lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal
range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long
range. When attacking a target beyond normal
range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You
can’t attack a target beyond the long range.

Reach

A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you
attack with it, as well as when determining your
reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.

Thrown

If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can
throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and
you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If
the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability
modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you
use for a melee attack with that weapon.

Two-Handed

A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when
you attack with it.

Versatile

A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two
hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with
the property. The weapon deals that damage when
used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Mastery Properties

Each weapon has a mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as
Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the
character. The properties are defined below.

Improvised Weapons

If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan,
or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see “Improvised
Weapons” in “Rules Glossary.” Also see those rules
if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using
a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.

90

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Graze

If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal
to the ability modifier you used to make the attack
roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the
weapon, and the damage can be increased only by
increasing the ability modifier.

Nick

When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra
attack only once per turn.

Push

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push
the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.

Sap

If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature
has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the
start of your next turn.

Slow

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal
damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit
more than once by weapons that have this property,
the Speed reduction doesn’t exceed 10 feet.

Topple

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force
the creature to make a Constitution saving throw
(DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the
attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed
save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Vex

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your
next attack roll against that creature before the end
of your next turn.

Armor

Armor Training

The Armor table lists the game’s main armor. The
table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well
as the following details:

Category. Every type of armor falls into a category:
Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines
how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as
shown in the table).
Armor Class (AC). The table’s Armor Class column
tells you what your base AC is when you wear a
type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather
Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity
modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.
Strength. If the table shows a Strength score in the
Strength column for an armor type, that armor
reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the
wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher
than the listed score.
Stealth. If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the
Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has
Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only
those with training can use them effectively, as
explained below. A character’s class and other features determine the character’s armor training.
A monster has training with any armor in its stat
block.

Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor

If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack
training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20
Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you
can’t cast spells.

Shield

You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if
you have training with it.

One at a Time

A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time
and wield only one Shield at a time.

of it must take an action to make a DC 10 Strength
(Athletics) check, freeing the Restrained creature
on a success. Destroying the Net (AC 10; 5 HP; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic damage) also frees the target, ending the effect.

Speed

A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half
speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships
can’t move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats
and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going
downstream, add the speed of the current (typically
3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These
vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and
weighs 100 pounds.

Crew
A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a
crew of skilled hirelings (see “Hirelings” later in
“Equipment”) to function. The minimum number of
skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on
the type of ship, as shown in the table.

Passengers

The table lists the number of Small and Medium
passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but
prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private
cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.

Damage Threshold

If a vehicle has a damage threshold (see “Rules Glossary”), it’s noted in the table.

Ship Repair

Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the
vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage
requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor. If the repairs are made in a location where supplies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city
shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.

Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a
fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment
maintenance, and other necessities.
At the start of each week or month (GM’s choice),
choose a lifestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor,
Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and
pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.
Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the
GM might take them into account when determining
risks or how others perceive your character.

Wretched (Free)

You survive via chance and charity. You’re often
exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping
outside.

Spell Level

Some magic items require a creature to form a
bond—called Attunement—with them before the
creature can use an item’s magical properties. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires Attunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits unless its description states otherwise. For example, a
magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the
benefits of a normal Shield if you aren’t attuned to
it, but none of its magical properties.

Attune during a Short Rest

Magic Items

Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short
Rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same Short Rest
used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can
take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon),
meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate
activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the
Short Rest, you’re attuned to the magic item and can
access its full magical capabilities.

Adventures hold the promise—but not a guarantee—of finding magic items. Hundreds of magic
items are detailed in “Magic Items” later in this document. Here’s what you need to know about using
magic items.

Ending Attunement

Identifying a Magic Item

Some magic items are indistinguishable from their
nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspicuously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to

102

give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learning a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic.
The Identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an
item’s properties. Alternatively, you can focus on
one magic item during a Short Rest while being in
physical contact with the item. At the end of the
rest, you learn its properties and how to use them
(but not any curse the item might bear).
Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might
be etched inside the band, or a feathered design
might hint that it’s a Ring of Feather Falling.
Wearing or experimenting with an item can also
offer hints about its properties. In the specific case
of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster
what a potion does. Other items might require more
experimentation. For example, if your character
puts on a Ring of Swimming, the GM might say, “Your
movement feels strangely fluid.” Perhaps you then
dive into a river to see what happens. The GM would
then say you swim unexpectedly well.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

No More Than Three Items

You can be attuned to no more than three magic
items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth
item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item
first. Additionally, you can’t attune to more than
one copy of an item. For example, you can’t attune to
more than one Ring of Protection at a time.
Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer
satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item
has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24
hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to

the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement
by spending another Short Rest focused on the item
unless the item is cursed.

Wearing and Wielding Items

Using a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn
must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on
feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head,
and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned,
a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about
the shoulders. A weapon must be held.
In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be
worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build.
Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or
they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.

Multiple Items of the Same Kind

You can’t wear more than one of certain magic
items. You can’t normally wear more than one pair
of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair
of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear,
or one cloak. The GM might make exceptions.

Paired Items

Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers,
gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only
if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a
character wearing a Boot of Striding and Springing
on one foot and a Boot of Elvenkind on the other foot
gains no benefit from either.

Crafting Nonmagical Items

To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw materials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If
you meet the requirements, you make the item, and
you can use it or sell it at its normal price.

Tools

The “Tools” section of “Equipment” lists which tools
are required to make certain items. The GM assigns
required tools for items not listed there.
You must use the required tool to make an item
and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who
helps you must also have proficiency with it.

Brewing Potions of Healing

A character who has proficiency with the Herbalism
Kit can create a Potion of Healing. Doing so requires
using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the
course of 1 day (8 hours of work).

Scribing Spell Scrolls

A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and create a Spell Scroll, using the rules below.

Time and Cost

Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money
based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell
Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you
must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple
days, those days needn’t be consecutive.

Prerequisites for the Scribe

To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the
Arcana skill or with Calligrapher’s Supplies and
have the spell prepared on each day of the inscription. You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes
its Material components, they are consumed only
when you complete the scroll. The scroll’s spell uses
your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.

Cantrips

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the
scroll works as if the caster were your level.

To make an item, you need raw materials worth

To determine how many days (working 8 hours a

If an item requires multiple days, the days needn’t
be consecutive.
Characters can combine their efforts to shorten
the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create
an item by the number of characters working on it.
Normally, only one other character can assist you,
but the GM might allow more assistants.

Spell Level

Gaining Spells
Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell
prepared in your mind or have access to the spell
from a magic item, such as a Spell Scroll. Your features specify which spells you have access to, if any;
whether you always have certain spells prepared;
and whether you can change the list of spells you
have prepared.

Preparing Spells

If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your
spellcasting feature specifies when you can change
the list and the number of spells you can change, as
summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table.

Most spellcasting monsters don’t change their lists
of prepared spells, but the GM is free to alter them.

Always-Prepared Spells

Certain features might give you a spell that you
always have prepared. If you also have a list of prepared spells that you can change, a spell that you
always have prepared doesn’t count against the
number of spells on that list.

Casting Spells

Each spell description has a series of entries that
provide the details needed to cast the spell. The following sections explain each of those entries, which
follow a spell’s name.

Casting in Armor

You must have training with any armor you are wearing to cast spells while wearing it. You are otherwise
too hampered by the armor for spellcasting.

104

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indicated in a spell’s description. A spell’s level is an
indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips—simple
spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0.
The rules for each spellcasting class say when its
members gain access to spells of certain levels.

Spell Slots

Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only
a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting.
Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster’s magical
potential is represented. Each spellcasting class
gives its members a limited number of spell slots of
certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard
has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.
When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that
spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with
the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain
size—small for a level 1 slot and larger for a higher-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any
size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that’s at
least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts Magic
Missile, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of
four level 1 slots and has three remaining.
Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell
slots.

Casting without Slots

There are several ways to cast a spell without
expending a spell slot:

Cantrips. A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.
Rituals. Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the
Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can
be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell
takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it
doesn’t expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.
Special Abilities. Some characters and monsters
have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to
cast the spell a limited number of times per day.
Magic Items. Spell Scrolls and some other magic
items contain spells that can be cast without a
spell slot. The description of such an item specifies how many times a spell can be cast from it.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is
of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on
the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a
Wizard casts Magic Missile using a level 2 slot, that
Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands
to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as Magic Missile and Cure
Wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a
higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.

your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you
don’t expend a spell slot. To cast the spell again, you
must start over.

Each spell belongs to a school of magic. The schools
are listed in the Schools of Magic table. These categories help describe spells but have no rules of their
own, although some other rules refer to them.

A spell’s range indicates how far from the spellcaster the spell’s effect can originate, and the spell’s
description specifies which part of the effect is limited by the range.
A range usually takes one of the following forms:

School of Magic

Schools of Magic

Typical Effects

Abjuration

Prevents or reverses harmful effects

Conjuration

Transports creatures or objects

Divination

Reveals information

Enchantment

Influences minds

Evocation

Channels energy to create effects that
are often destructive

Illusion

Necromancy

Manipulates life and death

Transmutation Transforms creatures or objects

Class Spell Lists
If a spell is on a class’s spell list, the class’s name
appears in parentheses after the spell’s school of
magic. Some features add a spell to a character’s
spell list even if the character isn’t a member of a
class in the parentheses.

Casting Time

Most spells require the Magic action to cast, but
some spells require a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or 1
minute or more. A spell’s Casting Time entry specifies which of those is required.

One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn

On a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast
a spell. This rule means you can’t, for example, cast
a spell with a spell slot using the Magic action and
another one using a Bonus Action on the same turn.

Reaction and Bonus Action Triggers

A spell that has a casting time of a Reaction is cast
in response to a trigger that is defined in the spell’s
Casting Time entry. Some spells that have a casting
time of a Bonus Action are also cast in response to a
trigger defined in the spell.

Longer Casting Times

Certain spells—including a spell cast as a Ritual—require more time to cast: minutes or even
hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of
1 minute or more, you must take the Magic action
on each of your turns, and you must maintain Concentration (see “Rules Glossary”) while you do so. If

105

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Range

Distance. The range is expressed in feet.
Touch. The spell’s effect originates on something,
as defined by the spell, that the spellcaster must
touch within their reach.
Self. The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates
from them, as specified in the spell.
If a spell has movable effects, they aren’t restricted
by its range unless the spell’s description says
otherwise.

Components

A spell’s components are physical requirements the
spellcaster must meet to cast the spell. Each spell’s
description indicates whether it requires Verbal
(V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components. If the
spellcaster can’t provide one or more of a spell’s
components, the spellcaster can’t cast the spell.

Verbal (V)

A Verbal component is the chanting of esoteric
words that sound like nonsense to the uninitiated.
The words must be uttered in a normal speaking
voice. The words themselves aren’t the source of the
spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of
sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the
threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is
gagged or in an area of magical silence can’t cast a
spell with a Verbal component.

Somatic (S)

A Somatic component is a forceful gesticulation
or an intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must
use at least one of their hands to perform these
movements.

Material (M)

A Material component is a particular material used
in a spell’s casting, as specified in parentheses in
the Components entry. These materials aren’t consumed by the spell unless the spell’s description
states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand
free to access them, but it can be the same hand
used to perform Somatic components, if any.
If a spell doesn’t consume its materials and
doesn’t specify a cost for them, a spellcaster can use
a Component Pouch (see “Equipment”) instead of
providing the materials specified in the spell, or the

spellcaster can substitute a Spellcasting Focus if the
caster has a feature that allows that substitution. To
use a Component Pouch, you must have a hand free
to reach into it, and to use a Spellcasting Focus, you
must hold it unless its description says otherwise
(see “Equipment” for descriptions).

Duration

A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of
the following forms:

Concentration. A duration that requires Concentration follows the Concentration rules (see “Rules
Glossary”).
Instantaneous. An instantaneous duration means
the spell’s magic appears only for a moment and
then disappears.
Time Span. A duration that provides a time span
specifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, minutes, hours, or the like. For example, a Duration
entry might say “1 minute,” meaning the spell
ends after 1 minute has passed. While a time-span
spell that you cast is ongoing, you can dismiss it
(no action required) if you don’t have the Incapacitated condition.

Effects

The effects of a spell are detailed after its duration entry. Those details present exactly what the
spell does, which ignores mundane physical laws;
any outcomes beyond those effects are under the
GM’s purview. Whatever the effects, they typically
deal with targets, saving throws, attack rolls, or all
three, each of which is detailed below.

Targets

A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or
more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A
spell’s description says whether the spell targets
creatures, objects, or something else.
A Clear Path to the Target. To target something
with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so
it can’t be behind Total Cover.
Targeting Yourself. If a spell targets a creature
of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the
creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature
other than you.
Areas of Effect. Some spells, such as Thunderwave, cover an area called an area of effect, which
is defined in “Rules Glossary.” The area determines
what the spell targets. The description of a spell
specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is
typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder,
Emanation, Line, or Sphere.

106

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Awareness of Being Targeted. Unless a spell has
a perceptible effect, a creature doesn’t know it was
targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt
to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell’s
description says otherwise.
Invalid Targets. If you cast a spell on someone
or something that can’t be affected by it, nothing
happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to
cast the spell, the slot is still expended.
If the spell normally has no effect on a target that
succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even
though it didn’t attempt one (giving no hint that the
creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.

Saving Throws

Many spells specify that a target makes a saving
throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The
spell specifies the ability that the target uses for
the save and what happens on a success or failure.
Here’s how to calculate the DC for your spells:

Spell save DC = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier
+ your Proficiency Bonus

Attack Rolls
Some spells require the caster to make an attack
roll to determine whether the spell hits a target.
Here’s how to calculate the attack modifier for your
spells:
Spell attack modifier = your spellcasting ability
modifier + your Proficiency Bonus

Combining Spell Effects
The effects of different spells add together while
their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of
the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine.
Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their
durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if
the castings are equally potent and their durations
overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast Bless on
the same target, that target gains the spell’s benefit
only once; the target doesn’t receive two bonus dice.
But if the durations of the spells overlap, the effect
continues until the duration of the second Bless
ends.

Identifying an Ongoing Spell

You can try to identify a non-instantaneous spell by
its observable effects if its duration is ongoing. To
identify it, you must take the Study action and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

Spell Descriptions
Acid Arrow

Level 2 Evocation (Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf)
Duration: Instantaneous

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target
within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a
ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the
target takes 4d4 Acid damage and 2d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow
splashes the target with acid for half as much of the
initial damage only.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage
(both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each
spell slot level above 2.

Acid Splash

Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

You create an acidic bubble at a point within range,
where it explodes in a 5-foot-radius Sphere. Each
creature in that Sphere must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw or take 1d6 Acid damage.
Cantrip Upgrade. The damage increases by 1d6
when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17
(4d6).

Aid

Level 2 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin,
Ranger)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a strip of white cloth)
Duration: 8 hours

Choose up to three creatures within range. Each
target’s Hit Point maximum and current Hit Points
increase by 5 for the duration.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. Each target’s Hit
Points increase by 5 for each spell slot level above 2.

Alarm

Level 1 Abjuration (Ranger, Wizard)

Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)
Duration: 8 hours

You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door,
a window, or an area within range that is no larger
than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm

107

System Reference Document 5.2.1

alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters
the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can
designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You
also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:
Audible Alarm. The alarm produces the sound of
a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet of the
warded area.
Mental Alarm. You are alerted by a mental ping
if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This
ping awakens you if you’re asleep.

Alter Self

Level 2 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You alter your physical form. Choose one of the
following options. Its effects last for the duration,
during which you can take a Magic action to replace
the option you chose with a different one.
Aquatic Adaptation. You sprout gills and grow
webs between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.
Change Appearance. You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your
height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice,
hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing
characteristics. You can make yourself appear as
a member of another species, though none of your
statistics change. You can’t appear as a creature of a
different size, and your basic shape stays the same;
if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become
quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can
take a Magic action to change your appearance in
this way again.
Natural Weapons. You grow claws (Slashing),
fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to
deal damage with that new growth, it deals 1d6
damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike,
and you use your spellcasting ability modifier
for the attack and damage rolls rather than using
Strength.

Animal Friendship

Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a morsel of food)
Duration: 24 hours

Target a Beast that you can see within range. The
target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
have the Charmed condition for the duration. If you

or one of your allies deals damage to the target, the
spells ends.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You can target
one additional Beast for each spell slot level above 1.

Animal Messenger

Animate Dead

Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a morsel of food)
Duration: 24 hours

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh,
and a pinch of bone dust)
Duration: Instantaneous

Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)

A Tiny Beast of your choice that you can see within
range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw,
or it attempts to deliver a message for you (if the
target’s Challenge Rating isn’t 0, it automatically
succeeds). You specify a location you have visited
and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a person dressed in the uniform of
the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a
pointed hat.” You also communicate a message of
up to twenty-five words. The Beast travels for the
duration toward the specified location, covering
about 25 miles per 24 hours or 50 miles if the Beast
can fly.
When the Beast arrives, it delivers your message
to the creature that you described, mimicking your
communication. If the Beast doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and
the Beast returns to where you cast the spell.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The spell’s duration increases by 48 hours for each spell slot level
above 2.

Animal Shapes

Level 8 Transmutation (Druid)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 24 hours

Choose any number of willing creatures that you
can see within range. Each target shape-shifts into
a Large or smaller Beast of your choice that has a
Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. You can choose a different form for each target. On later turns, you can
take a Magic action to transform the targets again.
A target’s game statistics are replaced by the
chosen Beast’s statistics, but the target retains its
creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; alignment;
ability to communicate; and Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma scores. The target’s actions are limited by the Beast form’s anatomy, and it can’t cast
spells. The target’s equipment melds into the new
form, and the target can’t use any of that equipment
while in that form.
The target gains a number of Temporary Hit
Points equal to the Hit Points of the first form into

108

which it shape-shifts. These Temporary Hit Points
vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The transformation lasts for the duration or until the target
ends it as a Bonus Action.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Level 3 Necromancy (Cleric, Wizard)

Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or
Small Humanoid within range. The target becomes
an Undead creature: a Skeleton if you chose bones
or a Zombie if you chose a corpse (see “Monsters”
for the stat blocks).
On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made
with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of
you (if you control multiple creatures, you can
command any of them at the same time, issuing the
same command to each one). You decide what action
the creature will take and where it will move on
its next turn, or you can issue a general command,
such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue
no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action
and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order,
the creature continues to follow it until its task is
complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you’ve
given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends.
This use of the spell reasserts your control over up
to four creatures you have animated with this spell
rather than animating a new creature.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You animate or
reassert control over two additional Undead creatures for each spell slot level above 3. Each of the
creatures must come from a different corpse or pile
of bones.

Animate Objects

Level 5 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Objects animate at your command. Choose a number of nonmagical objects within range that aren’t
being worn or carried, aren’t fixed to a surface, and
aren’t Gargantuan. The maximum number of objects
is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; for
this number, a Medium or smaller target counts as

one object, a Large target counts as two, and a Huge
target counts as three.
Each target animates, sprouts legs, and becomes
a Construct that uses the Animated Object stat
block; this creature is under your control until the
spell ends or until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each
creature you make with this spell is an ally to you
and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative
count and takes its turn immediately after yours.
Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action
to mentally command any creature you made with
this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if
you control multiple creatures, you can command
any of them at the same time, issuing the same
command to each one). If you issue no commands,
the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only
to avoid harm. When the creature drops to 0 Hit
Points, it reverts to its object form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The creature’s
Slam damage increases by 1d4 (Medium or smaller),
1d6 (Large), or 1d12 (Huge) for each spell slot level
above 5.

Antilife Shell

Level 5 Abjuration (Druid)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

An aura extends from you in a 10-foot Emanation
for the duration. The aura prevents creatures other
than Constructs and Undead from passing or reaching through it. An affected creature can cast spells

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Antimagic Field

Level 8 Abjuration (Cleric, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (iron filings)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

An aura of antimagic surrounds you in 10-foot Emanation. No one can cast spells, take Magic actions,
or create other magical effects inside the aura, and
those things can’t target or otherwise affect anything inside it. Magical properties of magic items
don’t work inside the aura or on anything inside it.
Areas of effect created by spells or other magic
can’t extend into the aura, and no one can teleport
into or out of it or use planar travel there. Portals
close temporarily while in the aura.
Ongoing spells, except those cast by an Artifact or
a deity, are suppressed in the area. While an effect
is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it
spends suppressed counts against its duration.
Dispel Magic has no effect on the aura, and the auras created by different Antimagic Field spells don’t
nullify each other.

or make attacks with Ranged or Reach weapons
through the barrier.
If you move so that an affected creature is forced
to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.

Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Wizard)

Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a mix of vinegar and honey)
Duration: 10 days

As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates
antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or
object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of
creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom
saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the
target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that
save:

Antipathy. The creature has the Frightened condition. The Frightened creature must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible
from the target, moving by the safest route.
Sympathy. The creature has the Charmed condition. The Charmed creature must use its movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the
target, moving by the safest route. If the creature
is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can’t
willingly move away. If the target damages the
Charmed creature, that creature can make a

Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

Ending the Effect. If the Frightened or Charmed
creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away
from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no
longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for
1 minute, after which it can be affected again.

Arcane Eye

Level 4 Divination (Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an Invisible, invulnerable eye within
range that hovers for the duration. You mentally
receive visual information from the eye, which can
see in every direction. It also has Darkvision with a
range of 30 feet.
As a Bonus Action, you can move the eye up to 30
feet in any direction. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s
movement, but the eye can pass through an opening
as small as 1 inch in diameter.

Arcane Hand

Level 5 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (an eggshell and a glove)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a Large hand of shimmering magical energy in an unoccupied space that you can see within
range. The hand lasts for the duration, and it moves
at your command, mimicking the movements of
your own hand.
The hand is an object that has AC 20 and Hit
Points equal to your Hit Point maximum. If it drops
to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends. The hand doesn’t occupy its space.
When you cast the spell and as a Bonus Action on
your later turns, you can move the hand up to 60
feet and then cause one of the following effects:
Clenched Fist. The hand strikes a target within 5
feet of it. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the
target takes 5d8 Force damage.
Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a Huge
or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. The target
must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or the
hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number
of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability
modifier. The hand moves with the target, remaining within 5 feet of it.

Arcanist’s Magic Aura
Level 2 Illusion (Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Touch

Components: V, S, M (a small square of silk)
Duration: 24 hours

With a touch, you place an illusion on a willing creature or an object that isn’t being worn or carried. A
creature gains the Mask effect below, and an object
gains the False Aura effect below. The effect lasts
for the duration. If you cast the spell on the same
target every day for 30 days, the illusion lasts until
dispelled.
Mask (Creature). Choose a creature type other
than the target’s actual type. Spells and other magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of
the chosen type.
False Aura (Object). You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect
magical auras, such as Detect Magic. You can make
a nonmagical object appear magical, make a magic

Components: V, S, M (for each of the spell’s targets,
one jacinth worth 1,000+ GP and one silver bar worth
100+ GP, all of which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled

You and up to eight willing creatures within range
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane
(the spell ends instantly if you are already on that
plane). Each target’s body is left behind in a state of
suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condition, doesn’t need food or air, and doesn’t age.
A target’s astral form resembles its body in almost
every way, replicating its game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of
a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder
blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view
after 1 foot. If the cord is cut—which happens only
when an effect states that it does so—the target’s
body and astral form both die.
A target’s astral form can travel through the Astral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that
plane, the target’s body and possessions travel
along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter
its body on the new plane.
Any damage or other effects that apply to an astral form have no effect on the target’s body and
vice versa. If a target’s body or astral form drops to
0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell
ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to
dismiss it.

the spell ends. The GM answers each question with
one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know

Contingency

Level 6 Abjuration (Wizard)
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a gem-encrusted statuette of
yourself worth 1,500+ GP)
Duration: 10 days

Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast,
that has a casting time of an action, and that can
target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting Contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell
doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect
when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that
trigger when you cast the two spells. For example,
a Contingency cast with Water Breathing might stipulate that Water Breathing comes into effect when
you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or
not you want it to, and then Contingency ends.
The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even
if it can normally target others. You can use only
one Contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell
again, the effect of another Contingency spell on you
ends. Also, Contingency ends on you if its material
component is ever not on your person.

Continual Flame

Level 2 Evocation (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)

Control Water

Level 4 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a mixture of water and dust)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, you control any water inside
an area you choose that is a Cube up to 100 feet on
a side, using one of the following effects. As a Magic
action on your later turns, you can repeat the same
effect or choose a different one.
Flood. You cause the water level of all standing
water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you

choose an area in a large body of water, you instead
create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side
of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge
or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried
with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of
capsizing.
The water level remains elevated until the spell
ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect
produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of
your next turn while the flood effect lasts.
Part Water. You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s
area, and the separated water forms a wall to either
side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you
choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills
in the trench over the course of the next round until
the normal water level is restored.
Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the
area to move in a direction you choose, even if the
water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in
other unlikely directions. The water in the area
moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the
spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain.
The water continues to move in the direction you
chose until the spell ends or you choose a different
effect.
Whirlpool. You cause a whirlpool to form in the
center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet
square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until
you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The
whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet
wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the
water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled
10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn
there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half
as much damage. A creature can swim away from
the whirlpool only if it first takes an action to pull
away and succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check
against your spell save DC.

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of
casting a spell. The creature makes a Constitution

with a spell slot, the slot isn’t expended.

Duration: Instantaneous

121

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up
to three corpses of Medium or Small Humanoids
within range. Each one becomes a Ghoul under your
control (see “Monsters” for its stat block).
As a Bonus Action on each of your turns, you can
mentally command any creature you animated with
this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if
you control multiple creatures, you can command
any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to them). You decide what action the creature
will take and where it will move on its next turn, or
you can issue a general command, such as to guard
a particular place. If you issue no commands, the
creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to
avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow the order until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any command you’ve
given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This
use of the spell reasserts your control over up to
three creatures you have animated with this spell
rather than animating new ones.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. If you use a level
7 spell slot, you can animate or reassert control
over four Ghouls. If you use a level 8 spell slot, you
can animate or reassert control over five Ghouls

larger than a 5-foot Cube, and the object must be of
a form and material that you have seen.
The spell’s duration depends on the object’s material, as shown in the Materials table. If the object

to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that
object. Covering that object with something opaque,

You create a shadowy Medium door on a flat solid
surface that you can see within range. This door can
be opened and closed, and it leads to a demiplane
that is an empty room 30 feet in each dimension,
made of wood or stone (your choice).
When the spell ends, the door vanishes, and any
objects inside the demiplane remain there. Any
creatures inside also remain unless they opt to be
shunted through the door as it vanishes, landing
with the Prone condition in the unoccupied spaces
closest to the door’s former space.
Each time you cast this spell, you can create a
new demiplane or connect the shadowy door to a
demiplane you created with a previous casting of
this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and

spell by another creature, you can connect the shadowy door to that demiplane instead.

to probe deeper into the target’s mind. If you probe
deeper, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, you discern the target’s reasoning,
emotions, and something that looms large in its
mind (such as a worry, love, or hate). On a successful
save, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows
that you are probing into its mind, and until you
shift your attention away from the target’s mind,
the target can take an action on its turn to make an
Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save
DC, ending the spell on a success.

Dimension Door

Level 4 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 500 feet

Duration: Instantaneous

You teleport to a location within range. You arrive

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor,
weapons, and other belongings on your person—
look different until the spell ends. You can seem
1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or
lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same
basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise,
the extent of the illusion is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold

cards or runes—worth 100+ GP)

You magically sense the most direct physical route
to a location you name. You must be familiar with
the location, and the spell fails if you name a destination on another plane of existence, a moving destination (such as a mobile fortress), or an unspecific
destination (such as “a green dragon’s lair”).
For the duration, as long as you are on the same
plane of existence as the destination, you know how
far it is and in what direction it lies. Whenever you

Duration: Instantaneous

You sense any trap within range that is within line
of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created

would sense the Alarm or Glyph of Warding spell or a
mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn’t reveal a natural
weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its
location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants
you Resistance to Cold damage, and the chill shield
grants you Resistance to Fire damage.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It lasts
for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn
within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving
throw, taking 2d6 Fire damage on a failed save or
half as much damage on a successful one.
As a Bonus Action, you can move the sphere up to
30 feet, rolling it along the ground. If you move the
sphere into a creature’s space, that creature makes
the save against the sphere, and the sphere stops
moving for the turn.

barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up
to 10 feet wide. Flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried start burning if touched by the

Flesh to Stone

Level 6 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a cockatrice feather)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to turn one creature that you can see
within range into stone. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has the Restrained condition for the duration. On a successful
save, its Speed is 0 until the start of your next turn.
Constructs automatically succeed on the save.
A Restrained target makes another Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it
successfully saves against this spell three times,
the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is
turned to stone and has the Petrified condition for
the duration. The successes and failures needn’t be
consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
If you maintain your Concentration on this spell
for the entire possible duration, the target is Petrified until the condition is ended by Greater Restoration or similar magic.

Floating Disk

Level 1 Conjuration (Wizard)

Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
Duration: 1 hour

This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of
force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats
3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space
of your choice that you can see within range. The
disk remains for the duration and can hold up to
500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell
ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.
The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet
of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the
disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of
you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down
stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the
disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could
it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.
If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to
follow you), the spell ends.

Fly

Level 3 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a feather)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

133

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of fog centered
on a point within range. The Sphere is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong
wind (such as one created by Gust of Wind) disperses it.

increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.

Forbiddance

Level 6 Abjuration (Cleric)

Casting Time: 10 minutes or Ritual
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,000+ GP)
Duration: 1 day

You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a
height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration,
creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals,
such as those created by the Gate spell, to enter the
area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel,
and therefore prevents creatures from accessing
the area by way of the Astral Plane, the Ethereal
Plane, the Feywild, the Shadowfell, or the Plane Shift
spell.
In addition, the spell damages types of creatures
that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or
more of the following: Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead. When a creature
of a chosen type enters the spell’s area for the first
time on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature
takes 5d10 Radiant or Necrotic damage (your
choice when you cast this spell).
You can designate a password when you cast the
spell. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.
The spell’s area can’t overlap with the area of
another Forbiddance spell. If you cast Forbiddance
every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell
lasts until it is dispelled, and the Material components are consumed on the last casting.

Forcecage

Level 7 Evocation (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500+ GP,
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

An immobile, Invisible, Cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence
around an area you choose within range. The prison
can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.
A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet
on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars
spaced 1/2 inch apart. A prison in the shape of a box
can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through
it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the
area.
When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures
only partially within the area, or those too large to
fit inside it, are pushed away from the center of the
area until they are completely outside it.
A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave, it must first
make a Charisma saving throw. On a successful
save, the creature can use that magic to exit the
cage. On a failed save, the creature doesn’t exit the
cage and wastes the spell or effect. The cage also
extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal
travel.
This spell can’t be dispelled by Dispel Magic.

Foresight

Level 9 Divination (Bard, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)
Duration: 8 hours

Level 4 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Touch

Duration: 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration,
the target’s movement is unaffected by Difficult
Terrain, and spells and other magical effects can

134

System Reference Document 5.2.1

neither reduce the target’s Speed nor cause the target to have the Paralyzed or Restrained conditions.
The target also has a Swim Speed equal to its Speed.
In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical
restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing
the Grappled condition on it.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You can target
one additional creature for each spell slot level
above 4.

Freezing Sphere

Level 6 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature crystal sphere)
Duration: Instantaneous

A frigid globe streaks from you to a point of
your choice within range, where it explodes in a
60-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area
makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6
Cold damage on failed save or half as much damage
on a successful one.
If the globe strikes a body of water, it freezes the
water to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet
square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that
were swimming on the surface of frozen water are
trapped in the ice and have the Restrained condition. A trapped creature can take an action to make
a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save
DC to break free.
You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell’s casting. If you do so, a globe about
the size of a sling bullet, cool to the touch, appears
in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you
give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of
40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal
range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect
as a normal casting of the spell. You can also set the
globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if
the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 6.

Gaseous Form

Level 3 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a bit of gauze)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

A willing creature you touch shape-shifts, along
with everything it’s wearing and carrying, into a
misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends on the
target if it drops to 0 Hit Points or if it takes a Magic
action to end the spell on itself.

While in this form, the target’s only method
of movement is a Fly Speed of 10 feet, and it can
hover. The target can enter and occupy the space
of another creature. The target has Resistance to
Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage; it has
Immunity to the Prone condition; and it has Advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving
throws. The target can pass through narrow openings, but it treats liquids as though they were solid
surfaces.
The target can’t talk or manipulate objects, and
any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be
dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. Finally, the target can’t attack or cast spells.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You can target
one additional creature for each spell slot level
above 3.

Gate

Level 9 Conjuration (Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth 5,000+ GP)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space
you can see within range to a precise location on a
different plane of existence. The portal is a circular
opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you
choose. The portal lasts for the duration, and the
portal’s destination is visible through it.
The portal has a front and a back on each plane
where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that
does so is instantly transported to the other plane,
appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the
portal.
Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.
When you cast this spell, you can speak the name
of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane
other than the one you are on, the portal opens
next to the named creature and transports it to the
nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal.
You gain no special power over the creature, and it
is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might
leave, attack you, or help you.

Geas

Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin,
Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: 30 days

135

System Reference Document 5.2.1

You give a verbal command to a creature that you
can see within range, ordering it to carry out some
service or refrain from an action or a course of activity as you decide. The target must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. The target automatically succeeds if it can’t understand your command.
While Charmed, the creature takes 5d10 Psychic
damage if it acts in a manner directly counter to
your command. It takes this damage no more than
once each day.
You can issue any command you choose, short
of an activity that would result in certain death.
Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell
ends.
A Remove Curse, Greater Restoration, or Wish spell
ends this spell.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. If you use a level
7 or 8 spell slot, the duration is 365 days. If you use
a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until it is ended by
one of the spells mentioned above.

Gentle Repose

Level 2 Necromancy (Cleric, Paladin, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (2 Copper Pieces, which the spell
consumes)
Duration: 10 days

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t
become Undead.
The spell also effectively extends the time limit on
raising the target from the dead, since days spent
under the influence of this spell don’t count against
the time limit of spells such as Raise Dead.

Giant Insect

Level 4 Conjuration (Druid)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You summon a giant centipede, spider, or wasp (chosen when you cast the spell). It manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within range and uses
the Giant Insect stat block. The form you choose
determines certain details in its stat block. The
creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or
when the spell ends.
The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In
combat, the creature shares your Initiative count,
but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It
obeys your verbal commands (no action required by
you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action
and uses its movement to avoid danger.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. Use the spell
slot’s level for the spell’s level in the stat block.

Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: 1 hour

Globe of Invulnerability

Level 6 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self

136

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Components: V, S, M (a glass bead)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

An immobile, shimmering barrier appears in a 10foot Emanation around you and remains for the
duration.
Any spell of level 5 or lower cast from outside the
barrier can’t affect anything within it. Such a spell
can target creatures and objects within the barrier,
but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the
area within the barrier is excluded from areas of
effect created by such spells.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The barrier
blocks spells of 1 level higher for each spell slot level
above 6.

Glyph of Warding

Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)

Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200+
GP, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical
effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a
table or a section of floor) or within an object that
can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal
the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger
than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is
moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this
spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a
successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your
spell save DC to notice.
When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger
and choose whether it’s an explosive rune or a spell
glyph, as explained below.
Set the Trigger. You decide what triggers the
glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed
on a surface, common triggers include touching or
stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of
it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common
triggers include opening that object or seeing the
glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can refine the trigger so that only creatures
of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph
could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set
conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph,
such as those who say a certain password.
Explosive Rune. When triggered, the glyph erupts
with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes
a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid,
Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your

choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save
or half as much damage on a successful one.
Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of
level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of
creating the glyph. The spell must target a single
creature or an area. The spell being stored has no
immediate effect when cast in this way.
When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell
takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the
creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects
an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the
spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful
objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to
the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage of
an explosive rune increases by 1d8 for each spell
slot level above 3. If you create a spell glyph, you can
store any spell of up to the same level as the spell
slot you use for the Glyph of Warding.

A creature you touch has the Invisible condition until the spell ends.

nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.
Uneaten berries disappear when the spell ends.

A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for
the duration in an unoccupied space that you can
see within range. The guardian occupies that space
and is invulnerable, and it appears in a form appropriate for your deity or pantheon.
Any enemy that moves to a space within 10 feet of
the guardian for the first time on a turn or starts its
turn there makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking
20 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes

Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a silver rod worth 10+ GP)
Duration: 24 hours

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square
feet of floor space. The warded area can be up to

one hundred 5-foot squares that are contiguous, or
twenty-five 10-foot squares that are contiguous.
When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by the spell’s effects. You can
also specify a password that, when spoken aloud
within 5 feet of the warded area, makes the speaker
immune to its effects.

The spell creates the effects below within the
warded area. Dispel Magic has no effect on Guards
and Wards itself, but each of the following effects
can be dispelled. If all four are dispelled, Guards and
Wards ends. If you cast the spell every day for 365
days on the same area, the spell thereafter lasts until all its effects are dispelled.
Corridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors,
making them Heavily Obscured. In addition, at each
intersection or branching passage offering a choice
of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a
creature other than you believes it is going in the
opposite direction from the one it chooses.
Doors. All doors in the warded area are magically
locked, as if sealed by the Arcane Lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion
to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
Stairs. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from
top to bottom, as in the Web spell. These strands
regrow in 10 minutes if they are destroyed while
Guards and Wards lasts.
Other Spell Effect. Place one of the following magical effects within the warded area:
• Dancing Lights in four corridors, with a simple
program that the lights repeat as long as Guards
and Wards lasts
• Magic Mouth in two locations
• Stinking Cloud in two locations (the vapors return
within 10 minutes if dispersed while Guards and
Wards lasts)
• Gust of Wind in one corridor or room (the wind
blows continuously while the spell lasts)

that enters that square receives the suggestion

made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like
a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and
smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment,

it. If a creature discerns that the terrain is illusory,

Thereafter, you can take a Magic action to speak
the object’s name and crush the sapphire. The object instantly appears in your hand regardless of

movement.
The spell can locate a specific creature known to
you or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such
as a human or a unicorn) if you have seen such a

Duration: 1 minute

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you

When you cast the spell, you can use the hand to
manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead.
The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in
the following ways:
• The creature can’t willingly enter the Cylinder
by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use

must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
• The creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls
against targets within the Cylinder.

• Targets within the Cylinder can’t be possessed

Magic Jar

Level 6 Necromancy (Wizard)

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a gem, crystal, or reliquary worth
500+ GP)
Duration: Until dispelled

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul
leaves it and enters the container you used for the
spell’s Material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You
can’t move or take Reactions. The only action you
can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of
the container, either returning to your living body
(and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a
Humanoid’s body.
You can attempt to possess any Humanoid within
100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded
by a Protection from Evil and Good or Magic Circle
spell can’t be possessed). The target makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul enters the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes
trapped in the container. On a successful save, the
target resists your efforts to possess it, and you
can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.
Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it.
Your Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Speed, and senses are replaced by the
creature’s. You otherwise keep your game statistics.
Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it
can’t move and it is Incapacitated.
While possessing a body, you can take a Magic action to return from the host body to the container if
it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while
you’re in it, the creature dies, and you make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting
DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is
within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.
If the container is destroyed or the spell ends,
your soul returns to your body. If your body is more
than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead,
you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container
when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to

146

System Reference Document 5.2.1

its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.
When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

Magic Missile

Level 1 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

You create three glowing darts of magical force.
Each dart strikes a creature of your choice that you
can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 Force
damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or
several.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The spell creates
one more dart for each spell slot level above 1.

Magic Mouth

Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)

Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (jade dust worth 10+ GP, which
the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled

You implant a message within an object in range—a
message that is uttered when a trigger condition is
met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t
being worn or carried by another creature. Then
speak the message, which must be 25 words or
fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 10
minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that
will trigger the spell to deliver your message.
When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your
voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks
like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue),
the magical mouth appears there, so the words
appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you
cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it
delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its
message whenever the trigger occurs.
The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you
like, though it must be based on visual or audible
conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object.
For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak
when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

Magic Weapon

Level 2 Transmutation (Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer,
Wizard)
Casting Time: Bonus Action
Range: Touch

Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour

You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell
ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a
+1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls. The spell
ends early if you cast it again.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The bonus increases to +2 with a level 3–5 spell slot. The bonus
increases to +3 with a level 6+ spell slot.

Magnificent Mansion

Level 7 Conjuration (Bard, Wizard)

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature door worth 15+ GP)
Duration: 24 hours

You conjure a shimmering door in range that lasts
for the duration. The door leads to an extradimensional dwelling and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall.
You and any creature you designate when you cast
the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling
as long as the door remains open. You can open or
close it (no action required) if you are within 30 feet
of it. While closed, the door is imperceptible.
Beyond the door is a magnificent foyer with
numerous chambers beyond. The dwelling’s atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
You can create any floor plan you like for the
dwelling, but it can’t exceed 50 contiguous 10-foot
Cubes. The place is furnished and decorated as you
choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a ninecourse banquet for up to 100 people. Furnishings
and other objects created by this spell dissipate into
smoke if removed from it.
A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends
all who enter. You determine the appearance of
these servants and their attire. They are invulnerable and obey your commands. Each servant can
perform tasks that a human could perform, but they
can’t attack or take any action that would directly
harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch
things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve
food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can’t leave
the dwelling.
When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left
inside the extradimensional space are expelled into
the unoccupied spaces nearest to the entrance.

Major Image

Level 3 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

147

You create the image of an object, a creature, or
some other visible phenomenon that is no larger

System Reference Document 5.2.1

than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot
that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and
temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but
it can’t deal damage or cause conditions.
If you are within range of the illusion, you can
take a Magic action to cause the image to move to
any other spot within range. As the image changes
location, you can alter its appearance so that its
movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move
it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be
walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to
make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to
be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image
can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for
what it is, the creature can see through the image,
and its other sensory qualities become faint to the
creature.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The spell lasts
until dispelled, without requiring Concentration, if
cast with a level 4+ spell slot.

Mass Cure Wounds

Level 5 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point
you can see within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on that
point. Each target regains Hit Points equal to 5d8

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The healing increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.

Mass Heal

Level 9 Abjuration (Cleric)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

A flood of healing energy flows from you into
creatures around you. You restore up to 700 Hit
Points, divided as you choose among any number of
creatures that you can see within range. Creatures
healed by this spell also have the Blinded, Deafened,
and Poisoned conditions removed from them.

Mass Healing Word

Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric)
Casting Time: Bonus Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous

Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see
within range regain Hit Points equal to 2d4 plus
your spellcasting ability modifier.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The healing increases by 1d4 for each spell slot level above 3.

Mass Suggestion

Level 6 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, M (a snake’s tongue)
Duration: 24 hours

You suggest a course of activity—described in no
more than 25 words—to twelve or fewer creatures
you can see within range that can hear and understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable
and not involve anything that would obviously deal
damage to any of the targets or their allies. For
example, you could say, “Walk to the village down
that road, and help the villagers there harvest crops
until sunset.” Or you could say, “Now is not the time
for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop in
an hour.”
Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the
target. Each Charmed target pursues the suggestion
to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can
continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time,
the spell ends for a target upon completing it.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The duration is
longer with a spell slot of level 7 (10 days), 8 (30
days), or 9 (366 days).

Maze

Level 8 Conjuration (Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You banish a creature that you can see within range
into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains
there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.
The target can take a Study action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and
the spell ends.

148

System Reference Document 5.2.1

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the
space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

Meld into Stone

Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 8 hours

You step into a stone object or surface large enough
to fully contain your body, merging yourself and
your equipment with the stone for the duration.
You must touch the stone to do so. Nothing of your
presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by
nonmagical senses.
While merged with the stone, you can’t see what
occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception)
checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made
with Disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while
merged in the stone. You can use 5 feet of movement
to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends
the spell. You otherwise can’t move.
Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm
you, but its partial destruction or a change in its
shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it)
expels you and deals 6d6 Force damage to you. The
stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into
a different substance) expels you and deals 50 Force
damage to you. If expelled, you move into an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered and
have the Prone condition.

Mending

Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer,
Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (two lodestones)
Duration: Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object
you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of
a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As
long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in
any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the
former damage.
This spell can physically repair a magic item, but
it can’t restore magic to such an object.

Message

Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer,
Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: S, M (a copper wire)
Duration: 1 round

You point toward a creature within range and
whisper a message. The target (and only the target)
hears the message and can reply in a whisper that
only you can hear.
You can cast this spell through solid objects if you
are familiar with the target and know it is beyond
the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal,
or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.

Meteor Swarm

Level 9 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 1 mile
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four
different points you can see within range. Each
creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on
each of those points makes a Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes 20d6 Fire damage and 20d6
Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as
much damage on a successful one. A creature in the
area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected only
once.
A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area,
and the object starts burning if it’s flammable.

Mind Blank

Level 8 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch
has Immunity to Psychic damage and the Charmed
condition. The target is also unaffected by anything
that would sense its emotions or alignment, read
its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and
no spell—not even Wish—can gather information
about the target, observe it remotely, or control its
mind.

Mind Spike

Level 2 Divination (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

149

You drive a spike of psionic energy into the mind of
one creature you can see within range. The target
makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 Psychic
damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
a successful one. On a failed save, you also always
know the target’s location until the spell ends, but
only while the two of you are on the same plane

System Reference Document 5.2.1

of existence. While you have this knowledge, the
target can’t become hidden from you, and if it has
the Invisible condition, it gains no benefit from that
condition against you.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.

Minor Illusion

Illusion Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within
range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends
if you cast this spell again.
If a creature takes a Study action to examine the
sound or image, the creature can determine that it
is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion
becomes faint to the creature.
Sound. If you create a sound, its volume can range
from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice,
someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of
drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound
continues unabated throughout the duration, or you
can make discrete sounds at different times before
the spell ends.
Image. If you create an image of an object—such
as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it
must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image
can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory
effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it
to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.

Mirage Arcane

Level 7 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Wizard)
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Sight
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 days

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square
look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other
sort of terrain. Open fields or a road could be made
to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other
rough or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to
seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle
slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth
road.
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures or add them where none are present. The spell
doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and
olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground

into Difficult Terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise
impede movement through the area. Any piece
of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick)
that is removed from the spell’s area disappears
immediately.
Creatures with Truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature
is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can
still physically interact with the illusion.

Mirror Image

Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your
space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with
you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s
impossible to track which image is real.
Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll
during the spell’s duration, roll a d6 for each of
your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls
a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of
you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates
otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The
spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the
Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight.

Mislead

Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You gain the Invisible condition at the same time
that an illusory double of you appears where you
are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but
the invisibility ends immediately after you make an
attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.
As a Magic action, you can move the illusory double up to twice your Speed and make it gesture,
speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It is
intangible and invulnerable.
You can see through its eyes and hear through its
ears as if you were located where it is.

Misty Step

Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: Bonus Action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous

150

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up
to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

Modify Memory

Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see within range
makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting
the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a
failed save, the target has the Charmed condition
for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the
target also has the Incapacitated condition and is
unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear
you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another
spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified.
While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s
memory of an event that it experienced within the
last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of
the event, allow the target to recall the event with
perfect clarity, change its memory of the event’s details, or create a memory of some other event.
You must speak to the target to describe how its
memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to
take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of
your description. If the spell ends before you finish
describing the modified memories, the creature’s
memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified
memories take hold when the spell ends.
A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect
how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations,
alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory,
such as a false memory of how much the creature
enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad
dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too
nonsensical to affect a creature.
A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell cast
on the target restores the creature’s true memory.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You can alter the
target’s memories of an event that took place up to
7 days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7
spell slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any
time in the creature’s past (level 9 spell slot).

Moonbeam

Level 2 Evocation (Druid)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a moonseed leaf)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a
5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a
point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light
fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on
later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.
When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it
makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the
creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the Polymorph spell, for example), it reverts to its true form
and can’t shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder.
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much
damage only. A creature also makes this save when
the spell’s area moves into its space and when it
enters the spell’s area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 2.

Move Earth

Level 6 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature shovel)
Duration: Concentration, up to 2 hours

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on
a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or
clay in the area in any manner you choose for the
duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall,
or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes
can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. For
example, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can
create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the
square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up
to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for
these changes to complete. Because the terrain’s
transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area
can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s
movement.
At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of
terrain to affect within range.
This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone
construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the
terrain would make a structure unstable, it might
collapse.
Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant
growth. The moved earth carries any plants along

Nondetection

Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Ranger, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action

151

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Components: V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth
25+ GP, which the spell consumes)
Duration: 8 hours

For the duration, you hide a target that you touch
from Divination spells. The target can be a willing
creature, or it can be a place or an object no larger
than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can’t
be targeted by any Divination spell or perceived
through magical scrying sensors.

Passwall

Level 5 Transmutation (Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)
Duration: 1 hour

A passage appears at a point that you can see on a
wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall,
ceiling, or floor) within range and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5
feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage
creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.
When the opening disappears, any creatures or
objects still in the passage created by the spell are
safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the
surface on which you cast the spell.

Pass without Trace

Level 2 Abjuration (Druid, Ranger)

Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (ashes from burned mistletoe)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You radiate a concealing aura in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and
each creature you choose have a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and leave no tracks.

Phantasmal Force

Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a
creature you can see within range. The target
makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed
save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or
other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot
Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for
the duration. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli.
The target can take a Study action to examine the
phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check
against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds,

the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion,
and the spell ends.
While affected by the spell, the target treats the
phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with it. For example, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge
and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists
and something else caused it to fall.
An affected target can even take damage from
the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous
creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a
phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of
the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a
type appropriate to the illusion.

Phantasmal Killer

Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can
see within range and create an illusion of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target
makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
target takes 4d10 Psychic damage and has Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the
duration. On a successful save, the target takes half
as much damage, and the spell ends.
For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed
save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a successful save, the spell ends.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 4.

Phantom Steed

Level 3 Illusion (Wizard)

Casting Time: 1 minute or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour

152

A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on
the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice
within range. You decide the creature’s appearance,
and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any
of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a
puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away
from the steed.
For the duration, you or a creature you choose
can ride the steed. The steed uses the Riding Horse
stat block (see “Monsters”), except it has a Speed of
100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When
the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the
rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if
the steed takes any damage.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Planar Ally

Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a demon prince, or
some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends
a Celestial, an Elemental, or a Fiend loyal to it to aid
you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied
space within range. If you know a specific creature’s
name, you can speak that name when you cast this
spell to request that creature, though you might get
a different creature anyway (GM’s choice).
When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it
to perform a service in exchange for payment, but
it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could
range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help
us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or
protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You
must be able to communicate with the creature to
bargain for its services.
Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial
might require a sizable donation of gold or magic
items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some
creatures might exchange their service for a quest
undertaken by you.
A task that can be measured in minutes requires a
payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured
in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task
measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000
GP per day. The GM can adjust these payments
based on the circumstances under which you cast
the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s
ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.
Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the
suggested payment, while especially dangerous
tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely
accept tasks that seem suicidal.
After the creature completes the task, or when the
agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back
to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a
price for the creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.

Planar Binding

Level 5 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Warlock,
Wizard)

Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a jewel worth 1,000+ GP, which
the spell consumes)
Duration: 24 hours

You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a
Fey, or a Fiend to your service. The creature must
be within range for the entire casting of the spell.
(Typically, the creature is first summoned into the
center of the inverted version of the Magic Circle
spell to trap it while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must succeed on
a Charisma saving throw or be bound to serve you
for the duration. If the creature was summoned or
created by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.
A bound creature must follow your commands
to the best of its ability. You might command the
creature to accompany you on an adventure, to
guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the
creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your commands to achieve its own objectives. If the creature
carries out your commands completely before the
spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you
are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a
different plane, it returns to the place where you
bound it and remains there until the spell ends.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The duration
increases with a spell slot of level 6 (10 days), 7 (30
days), 8 (180 days), and 9 (366 days).

Plane Shift

GP and attuned to a plane of existence)
Duration: Instantaneous

You and up to eight willing creatures who link
hands in a circle are transported to a different plane
of existence. You can specify a target destination in
general terms, such as a specific city on the Elemental Plane of Fire or palace on the second level of the
Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination, as determined by the GM.
Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a
teleportation circle on another plane of existence,
this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you
transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied
spaces next to the circle.

Plant Growth

Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action (Overgrowth) or
8 hours (Enrichment)
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

153

System Reference Document 5.2.1

This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting
time you use determines whether the spell has the
Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below.
Overgrowth. Choose a point within range. All
normal plants in a 100-foot-radius Sphere centered
on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 4 feet of
movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude
one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area
from being affected.
Enrichment. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for
365 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount
of food when harvested. They can benefit from only
one Plant Growth per year.

Polymorph

Level 4 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You attempt to transform a creature that you can
see within range into a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into
a Beast form for the duration. That form can be any
Beast you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal
to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level if
it doesn’t have a Challenge Rating). The target’s
game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the
chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment,
personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point
Dice. See the “Animals” section of “Monsters” for a
sample of Beast stat blocks.
The target gains a number of Temporary Hit
Points equal to the Hit Points of the Beast form.
These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain
when the spell ends. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points left.
The target is limited in the actions it can perform
by the anatomy of its new form, and it can’t speak or
cast spells.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The
creature can’t use or otherwise benefit from any of
that equipment.

Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes

A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms
a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet
high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point within
range. Alternatively, you shape the wall into a globe
up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within
range. The wall lasts for the duration. If you position the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the
spell ends instantly without effect.
The wall sheds Bright Light within 100 feet and
Dim Light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate when you cast the spell can
pass through and be near the wall without harm. If
another creature that can see the wall moves within
20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or
have the Blinded condition for 1 minute.
The wall consists of seven layers, each with a
different color. When a creature reaches into or
passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a
time through all the layers. Each layer forces the
creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described in the
Prismatic Layers table.
The wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one
layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means

Private Sanctum

Components: V, S, M (jade dust worth 25+ GP)
Duration: Until dispelled

Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead)
Duration: 24 hours

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or
some other visible phenomenon within range that
activates when a specific trigger occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger
than a 30-foot Cube, and you decide when you cast
the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds
it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5
minutes.
When the trigger you specify occurs, the illusion
springs into existence and performs in the manner
you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes, after which the illusion can be activated again.
The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you
like, though it must be based on visual or audible
phenomena that occur within 30 feet of the area.
For example, you could create an illusion of yourself
to appear and warn off others who attempt to open
a trapped door.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it
to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A
creature that takes the Study action to examine
the image can determine that it is an illusion with a
successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against
your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the
image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the
creature.

Level 4 Abjuration (Wizard)

You make an area within range magically secure.
The area is a Cube that can be as small as 5 feet to
as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for
the duration.
When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of
security the spell provides, choosing any of the following properties:

• Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge
of the warded area.
• The barrier of the warded area appears dark and
foggy, preventing vision (including Darkvision)
through it.
• Sensors created by Divination spells can’t appear
inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
• Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by Divination spells.
• Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded
area.
• Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.
Casting this spell on the same spot every day for
365 days makes the spell last until dispelled.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You can increase
the size of the Cube by 100 feet for each spell slot
level above 4.

Produce Flame

Conjuration Cantrip (Druid)
Casting Time: Bonus Action

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame
emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds
Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an
additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.
Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to
hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of
you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target
takes 1d8 Fire damage.

Casting Time: Action
Range: 500 miles
Components: V, S, M (a statuette of yourself worth
5+ GP)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 day

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for
the duration. The copy can appear at any location
within range that you have seen before, regardless
of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and
sounds like you, but it is intangible. If the illusion
takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.
You can see through the illusion’s eyes and hear
through its ears as if you were in its space. As a
Magic action, you can move it up to 60 feet and
make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way
you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it
to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A
creature that takes the Study action to examine
the image can determine that it is an illusion with a
successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against
your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the

image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the
creature.

The creature returns to life with 1 Hit Point. This
spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected the

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t
restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—
its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to D20 Tests. Every time the

Resilient Sphere

Level 4 Abjuration (Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a glass sphere)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A shimmering sphere encloses a Large or smaller
creature or object within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or
be enclosed for the duration.
Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other
spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or
out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe
there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a
creature or object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a
creature inside the sphere damage anything outside
it.
The sphere is weightless and just large enough to
contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed
creature can take an action to push against the
sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half
the creature’s Speed. Similarly, the globe can be
picked up and moved by other creatures.
A Disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it
without harming anything inside.

Resistance

You touch a willing creature and choose a damage
type: Acid, Bludgeoning, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Piercing, Poison, Radiant, Slashing, or Thunder. When the creature takes damage of the chosen

total damage taken by 1d4. A creature can benefit
from this spell only once per turn.

Resurrection

Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth 1,000+ GP,
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous

With a touch, you revive a dead creature that has
been dead for no more than a century, didn’t die of
old age, and wasn’t Undead when it died.
The creature returns to life with all its Hit Points.
This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected
the creature at the time of death. This spell closes
all mortal wounds and restores any missing body
parts.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to D20 Tests. Every time the
target finishes a Long Rest, the penalty is reduced
by 1 until it becomes 0.
Casting this spell to revive a creature that has
been dead for 365 days or longer taxes you. Until
you finish a Long Rest, you can’t cast spells again,
and you have Disadvantage on D20 Tests.

You touch a rope. One end of it hovers upward until
the rope hangs perpendicular to the ground or the
rope reaches a ceiling. At the rope’s upper end, an
Invisible 3-foot-by-5-foot portal opens to an extra­
dimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.
That space can be reached by climbing the rope,
which can be pulled into or dropped out of it.
The space can hold up to eight Medium or smaller
creatures. Attacks, spells, and other effects can’t
pass into or out of the space, but creatures inside
it can see through the portal. Anything inside the
space drops out when the spell ends.

Casting Time: Action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17
(4d8).

Reverse Gravity

Level 7 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100foot high Cylinder centered on a point within range.
All creatures and objects in that area that aren’t
anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the
top of the Cylinder. A creature can make a Dexterity
saving throw to grab a fixed object it can reach, thus
avoiding the fall upward.
If a ceiling or an anchored object is encountered
in this upward fall, creatures and objects strike it
just as they would during a downward fall. If an affected creature or object reaches the Cylinder’s top
without striking anything, it hovers there for the
duration. When the spell ends, affected objects and
creatures fall downward.

a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell
doesn’t protect the warded creature from areas of
effect. The spell ends if the warded creature makes
an attack roll, casts a spell, or deals damage.

Wizard)

You can see and hear a creature you choose that is
on the same plane of existence as you. The target
makes a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified
(see the tables below) by how well you know the
target and the sort of physical connection you have
to it. The target doesn’t know what it is making the
save against, only that it feels uneasy.
Your Knowledge of the Target Is …

Save Modifier

Secondhand (heard of the target)

+5

Firsthand (met the target)

+0

Extensive (know the target well)

You Have the Target’s …

Save Modifier

−2

Garment or other possession

−4

Body part, lock of hair, or bit of nail

−10

On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and
you can’t use this spell on it again for 24 hours.
On a failed save, the spell creates an Invisible,
intangible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You
can see and hear through the sensor as if you were
there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining
within 10 feet of it for the duration. If something
can see the sensor, it appears as a luminous orb
about the size of your fist.
Instead of targeting a creature, you can target a
location you have seen. When you do so, the sensor
appears at that location and doesn’t move.

save, the spell ends.

increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Level 4 Conjuration (Wizard)

You hide a chest and all its contents on the Ethereal
Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature
replica that serve as Material components for the
spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of
nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).
While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane,
you can take a Magic action and touch the replica to
recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space
on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the
chest back to the Ethereal Plane by taking a Magic
action to touch the chest and the replica.
After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent
chance at the end of each day that the spell ends.
The spell also ends if you cast this spell again or if
the Tiny replica chest is destroyed. If the spell ends
and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, the
chest remains there for you or someone else to find.

See Invisibility

Level 2 Divination (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of talc)
Duration: 1 hour

For the duration, you see creatures and objects that
have the Invisible condition as if they were visible,
and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Creatures
and objects there appear ghostly.

Seeming

Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 8 hours

You give an illusory appearance to each creature of
your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw,
and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
You can give the same appearance or different
ones to the targets. The spell can change the appearance of the targets’ bodies and equipment.
You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or
taller and appear heavier or lighter. A target’s new
appearance must have the same basic arrangement
of limbs as the target, but the extent of the illusion

is otherwise up to you. The spell lasts for the
duration.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up
to physical inspection. For example, if you use this
spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass
through the hat.
A creature that takes the Study action to examine
a target can make an Intelligence (Investigation)
check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it
becomes aware that the target is disguised.

Sending

Level 3 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Unlimited
Components: V, S, M (a copper wire)
Duration: Instantaneous

You send a short message of 25 words or fewer to
a creature you have met or a creature described to
you by someone who has met it. The target hears
the message in its mind, recognizes you as the
sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like
manner immediately. The spell enables targets to
understand the meaning of your message.
You can send the message across any distance and
even to other planes of existence, but if the target
is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent
chance that the message doesn’t arrive. You know if
the delivery fails.
Upon receiving your message, a creature can
block your ability to reach it again with this spell for
8 hours. If you try to send another message during
that time, you learn that you are blocked, and the
spell fails.

Sequester

Invisible condition and can’t be targeted by Divination spells, detected by magic, or viewed remotely
with magic.
If the target is a creature, it enters a state of suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condition,
doesn’t age, and doesn’t need food, water, or air.
You can set a condition for the spell to end early.
The condition can be anything you choose, but it
must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target.
Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the
tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

into a different eligible form. The new form must be
of a creature that has a Challenge Rating no higher
than your level or Challenge Rating. You must have
seen the sort of creature before, and it can’t be a
Construct or an Undead.
When you cast the spell, you gain a number of
Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the
first form into which you shape-shift. These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain when the spell
ends.
Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block
of the chosen form, but you retain your creature
type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma scores; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you have
the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.

and shape to fit the new form while you’re in it.

Casting Time: Bonus Action
Range: Self

A Club or Quarterstaff you are holding is imbued
with nature’s power. For the duration, you can use
your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the
attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that
weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes
a d8. If the attack deals damage, it can be Force
damage or the weapon’s normal damage type (your
choice).
The spell ends early if you cast it again or if you let
go of the weapon.
Cantrip Upgrade. The damage die changes when
you reach levels 5 (d10), 11 (d12), and 17 (2d6).

Silence

Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Cleric, Ranger)

Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within
or pass through a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered
on a point you choose within range. Any creature
or object entirely inside the Sphere has Immunity
to Thunder damage, and creatures have the Deafened condition while entirely inside it. Casting a
spell that includes a Verbal component is impossible
there.

Silent Image

Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or
some other visible phenomenon that is no larger
than a 15-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot
within range and lasts for the duration. The image
is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound,
smell, or other sensory effects.
As a Magic action, you can cause the image
to move to any spot within range. As the image
changes location, you can alter its appearance so
that its movements appear natural for the image.
For example, if you create an image of a creature
and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to
be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A
creature that takes a Study action to examine the
image can determine that it is an illusion with a
successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against
your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the
image.

Simulacrum

Level 7 Illusion (Wizard)

Casting Time: 12 hours
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (powdered ruby worth 1,500+ GP,
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled

You create a simulacrum of one Beast or Humanoid
that is within 10 feet of you for the entire casting of
the spell. You finish the casting by touching both the
creature and a pile of ice or snow that is the same
size as that creature, and the pile turns into the
simulacrum, which is a creature. It uses the game
statistics of the original creature at the time of casting, except it is a Construct, its Hit Point maximum
is half as much, and it can’t cast this spell.
The simulacrum is Friendly to you and creatures
you designate. It obeys your commands and acts on
your turn in combat. The simulacrum can’t gain levels, and it can’t take Short or Long Rests.
If the simulacrum takes damage, the only way
to restore its Hit Points is to repair it as you take a
Long Rest, during which you expend components
worth 100 GP per Hit Point restored. The simulacrum must stay within 5 feet of you for the repair.
The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 Hit Points,
at which point it reverts to snow and melts away. If
you cast this spell again, any simulacrum you created with this spell is instantly destroyed.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius
Sphere centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn,
at which point it must repeat the save. If the target
fails the second save, the target has the Unconscious
condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it
takes an action to shake it out of the spell’s effect.
Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, or that
have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.

Ground in the Cylinder is Difficult Terrain. When
a creature enters the Cylinder for the first time on
a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a

163

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition
and lose Concentration.

Slow

Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of molasses)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your
choice in a 40-foot Cube within range. Each target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.
An affected target’s Speed is halved, it takes a −2
penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it
can’t take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either
an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can
make only one attack if it takes the Attack action. If
it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is
a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a result of the
target making the spell’s gestures too slowly.
An affected target repeats the save at the end
of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a
success.

Sorcerous Burst

Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Component: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

You cast sorcerous energy at one creature or object
within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the
target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 damage of a
type you choose: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison,
Psychic, or Thunder.
If you roll an 8 on a d8 for this spell, you can roll
another d8, and add it to the damage. When you cast
this spell, the maximum number of these d8s you
can add to the spell’s damage equals your spellcasting ability modifier.
Cantrip Upgrade. The damage increases by 1d8
when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17
(4d8).

Spare the Dying

Necromancy Cantrip (Cleric, Druid)

feet).

Speak with Animals

Level 1 Divination (Bard, Druid, Ranger, Warlock)
Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes

For the duration, you can comprehend and verbally
communicate with Beasts, and you can use any of
the Influence action’s skill options with them.
Most Beasts have little to say about topics that
don’t pertain to survival or companionship, but at
minimum, a Beast can give you information about
nearby locations and monsters, including whatever
it has perceived within the past day.

Speak with Dead

Level 3 Necromancy (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (burning incense)
Duration: 10 minutes

You grant the semblance of life to a corpse of your
choice within range, allowing it to answer questions you pose. The corpse must have a mouth, and
this spell fails if the deceased creature was Undead
when it died. The spell also fails if the corpse was
the target of this spell within the past 10 days.
Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to
five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew
in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are
usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse
is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if
you are antagonistic toward it or it recognizes you
as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s
soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the
corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and
can’t speculate about future events.

Speak with Plants

Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes

You imbue plants in an immobile 30-foot Emanation
with limited sentience and animation, giving them
the ability to communicate with you and follow your
simple commands. You can question plants about
events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed,
weather, and other circumstances.
You can also turn Difficult Terrain caused by plant
growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into
ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you

164

System Reference Document 5.2.1

can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present
into Difficult Terrain that lasts for the duration.
The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can move their
branches, tendrils, and stalks for you.
If a Plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language.

Spider Climb

Level 2 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch
gains the ability to move up, down, and across
vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving
its hands free. The target also gains a Climb Speed
equal to its Speed.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You can target
one additional creature for each spell slot level
above 2.

Spike Growth

Level 2 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (seven thorns)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered
on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and
thorns. The area becomes Difficult Terrain for the
duration. When a creature moves into or within the
area, it takes 2d4 Piercing damage for every 5 feet it
travels.
The transformation of the ground is camouflaged
to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area
when the spell is cast must take a Search action
and succeed on a Wisdom (Perception or Survival)
check against your spell save DC to recognize the
terrain as hazardous before entering it.

Spirit Guardians

Level 3 Conjuration (Cleric)

Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a prayer scroll)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Protective spirits flit around you in a 15-foot Emanation for the duration. If you are good or neutral,
their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your
choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.
When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature’s
Speed is halved in the Emanation, and whenever the
Emanation enters a creature’s space and whenever

a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn
there, the creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 Radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 Necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save,
the creature takes half as much damage. A creature
makes this save only once per turn.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.

Spiritual Weapon

Level 2 Evocation (Cleric)

Casting Time: Bonus Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral force that resembles
a weapon of your choice and lasts for the duration.
The force appears within range in a space of your
choice, and you can immediately make one melee
spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of the
force. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal
to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can
move the force up to 20 feet and repeat the attack
against a creature within 5 feet of it.

167

You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface
(such as a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest). The
glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in
diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain in
place; if it is moved more than 10 feet from where
you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell
ends without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a
successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your
spell save DC to notice.
When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger
and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death,
Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is
explained below.
Set the Trigger. You decide what triggers the
glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed
on a surface, common triggers include touching or
stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of
it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common
triggers include opening that object or seeing the
glyph.
You can refine the trigger so that only creatures
of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph
could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set
conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph,
such as those who say a certain password.
Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a
60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10

System Reference Document 5.2.1

minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each
creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is
targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the
Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn
there. A creature is targeted only once per turn.
Death. Each target makes a Constitution saving
throw, taking 10d10 Necrotic damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful save.

throw. On a failed save, a target argues with other
creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

saving throw or have the Frightened condition for
1 minute. While Frightened, the target must move
at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its
turns, if able.
Pain. Each target must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition
for 1 minute.
Sleep. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Unconscious condition for 10
minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell
and as a Magic action on your later turns before the
spell ends, you can exert your will on one creature
or object that you can see within range, causing the
appropriate effect below. You can affect the same
target round after round or choose a new one at any
time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no
longer affected by the spell.
Creature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller
creature. The target must succeed on a Strength
saving throw, or you move it up to 30 feet in any
direction within the spell’s range. Until the end of
your next turn, the creature has the Restrained condition, and if you lift it into the air, it is suspended
there. It falls at the end of your next turn unless you
use this option on it again and it fails the save.
Object. You can try to move a Huge or smaller
object. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you
automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction
within the spell’s range.

creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw,
or you pull the object away and move it up to 30 feet

Familiarity

168

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Familiarity. Here are the meanings of the terms
in the table’s Familiarity column:

• “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.
• “Linked object” means you possess an object taken
from the desired destination within the last six
months, such as a book from a wizard’s library.
• “Very familiar” is a place you have visited often,
a place you have carefully studied, or a place you
can see when you cast the spell.
• “Seen casually” is a place you have seen more
than once but with which you aren’t very familiar.
• “Viewed once or described” is a place you have
seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you
know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.
• “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist.
Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but
instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting
to teleport to a location that no longer exists.
Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in
a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the
target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the GM
rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).
Similar Area. You and your group (or the target
object) appear in a different area that’s visually or
thematically similar to the target area. You appear
in the closest similar place. If you are heading for
your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person’s laboratory in the same city.
Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear 2d12 miles away from the destination
in a random direction. Roll 1d8 for the direction: 1,
east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6,
northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.
On Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you intended.

Teleportation Circle

Level 5 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, M (rare inks worth 50+ GP, which the
spell consumes)
Duration: 1 round

As you cast the spell, you draw a 5-foot-radius circle
on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your
location to a permanent teleportation circle of your
choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is
on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and
remains open until the end of your next turn. Any
creature that enters the portal instantly appears
within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guildhalls, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles.
Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a
string of runes arranged in a particular pattern.
When you first gain the ability to cast this spell,
you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations
on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You
might learn additional sigil sequences during your
adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to
memory after studying it for 1 minute.
You can create a permanent teleportation circle
by casting this spell in the same location every day
for 365 days.

All other creatures and objects are barred from
passing through it. Spells of level 3 or lower can’t be
cast through it, and the effects of such spells can’t
extend into it.
The atmosphere inside the Emanation is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Until
the spell ends, you can command the interior to have
Dim Light or Darkness (no action required). The Emanation is opaque from the outside and of any color
you choose, but it’s transparent from the inside.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving
throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.
Creature into Creature. If you turn a creature
into another kind of creature, the new form can be
any kind you choose that has a Challenge Rating
equal to or less than the target’s Challenge Rating
or level. The target’s game statistics are replaced by
the stat block of the new form, but it retains its Hit

These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain
when the spell ends.
The target is limited in the actions it can perform

control the creature. It might remain Friendly to
you, depending on how you have treated it.

damage on a successful one.
At the start of each of your turns after the wall
appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it,

At the end of the turn, the wall’s height is reduced

A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the wave’s force, though, the creature must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check

Points, the spell ends.
Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you
can mentally command the servant to move up to
15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can
perform simple tasks that a human could do, such as
fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes,
lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks.
Once you give the command, the servant performs
the task to the best of its ability until it completes
the task, then waits for your next command.

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds.
Make a melee spell attack against one creature
within reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 Necrotic
damage, and you regain Hit Points equal to half the
amount of Necrotic damage dealt.
Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again
on each of your turns as a Magic action, targeting
the same creature or a different one.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 3.

Wall of Force

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle
enchantments at one creature you can see or hear
within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or take 1d6 Psychic damage and have
Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before
the end of its next turn.
Cantrip Upgrade. The damage increases by 1d6

Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of bile)
Duration: Instantaneous

You point at a location within range, and a glowing, 1-foot-diameter ball of acid streaks there and
explodes in a 20-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature
in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, a creature takes 10d4 Acid damage and
another 5d4 Acid damage at the end of its next turn.
On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial
damage only.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The initial damage increases by 2d4 for each spell slot level above
4.

Wall of Fire

Level 4 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of charcoal)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within
range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20
feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20
feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The
wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.
When the wall appears, each creature in its area
makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 Fire
damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
a successful one.
One side of the wall, selected by you when you
cast this spell, deals 5d8 Fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or
inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage
when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or
ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals
no damage.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.

172

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Level 5 Evocation (Wizard)

An Invisible wall of force springs into existence at
a point you choose within range. The wall appears
in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or
vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating
or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a
hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up
to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up
of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must
be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the
wall is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for the duration. If
the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall
(you choose which side).
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It
is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by
Dispel Magic. A Disintegrate spell destroys the wall
instantly, however. The wall also extends into the
Ethereal Plane and blocks ethereal travel through
the wall.

Wall of Ice

Level 6 Evocation (Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of quartz)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within
range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome
or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can
shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square
panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another
panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts
for the duration.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when
it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the
wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity
saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
The wall is an object that can be damaged and
thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 Hit Points per
10-foot section, and it has Immunity to Cold, Poison, and Psychic damage and Vulnerability to Fire
damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 Hit
Points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid
air in the space the wall occupied.
A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air
for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution
saving throw, taking 5d6 Cold damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage the
wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6 and the
damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air
increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 6.

Wall of Stone

Level 5 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a cube of granite)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall
is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with
another panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-footby-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when
it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the
wall (you choose which side). If a creature would
be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall
and another solid surface), that creature can make
a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its
Reaction to move up to its Speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it
can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object.
The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on a firm
foundation. It must, however, merge with and be
solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can
use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length,
you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create battlements and the like.
The wall is an object made of stone that can be
damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15
and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness, and it has
Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. Reducing
a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might cause
connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.
If you maintain your Concentration on this spell
for its full duration, the wall becomes permanent
and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

Wall of Thorns

Level 6 Conjuration (Druid)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a handful of thorns)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with
needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range
on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You
choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet

173

System Reference Document 5.2.1

high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot
diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick.
The wall blocks line of sight.
When the wall appears, each creature in its area
makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage
on a successful one.
A creature can move through the wall, albeit
slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature
moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of
movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature
enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn
there, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw,
taking 7d8 Slashing damage on a failed save or half
as much damage on a successful one. A creature
makes this save only once per turn.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. Both types of
damage increase by 1d8 for each spell slot level
above 6.

Warding Bond

Level 2 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)

Casting Time: Action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth
50+ GP each, which you and the target must wear for
the duration)
Duration: 1 hour

You touch another creature that is willing and
create a mystic connection between you and the
target until the spell ends. While the target is
within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and
saving throws, and it has Resistance to all damage.
Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same
amount of damage.
The spell ends if you drop to 0 Hit Points or if you
and the target become separated by more than 60
feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of
the connected creatures.

Water Breathing

Level 3 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer,
Wizard)
Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a short reed)
Duration: 24 hours

This spell grants up to ten willing creatures of your
choice within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also
retain their normal mode of respiration.

Water Walk

Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer)
Casting Time: Action or Ritual
Range: 30 feet

Components: V, S, M (a piece of cork)
Duration: 1 hour

This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid
surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand,
or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage
from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures of your
choice within range gain this ability for the duration.
An affected target must take a Bonus Action to
pass from the liquid’s surface into the liquid itself
and vice versa, but if the target falls into the liquid,
the target passes through the surface into the liquid
below.

Web

Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point
within range. The webs fill a 20-foot Cube there for
the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain, and the
area within them is Lightly Obscured.
If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid
masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across
a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself,
and the spell ends at the start of your next turn.
Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5
feet.
The first time a creature enters the webs on a
turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.
A creature Restrained by the webs can take an
action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against
your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer
Restrained.
The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs
exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4
Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in
the fire.

Weird

Level 9 Illusion (Warlock, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

174

You try to create illusory terrors in others’ minds.
Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius
Sphere centered on a point within range makes a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target
takes 10d10 Psychic damage and has the Frightened
condition for the duration. On a successful save, a
target takes half as much damage only.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

A Frightened target makes a Wisdom saving
throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed
save, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage. On a successful
save, the spell ends on that target.

Wind Walk

Level 6 Transmutation (Druid)

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a candle)
Duration: 8 hours

You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice
within range assume gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this
cloud form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and
can hover; it has Immunity to the Prone condition;
and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and
Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take
in this form are the Dash action or a Magic action to
begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes
1 minute, during which the target has the Stunned
condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert
to cloud form, which also requires a Magic action
followed by a 1-minute transformation.
If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for
1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t
land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance.

Wind Wall

Level 3 Evocation (Druid, Ranger)

Casting Time: Action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a fan and a feather)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a
point you choose within range. You can make the
wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot
thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose
so long as it makes one continuous path along the
ground. The wall lasts for the duration.
When the wall appears, each creature in its area
makes a Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one.
The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other
gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or
objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward.
Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles
launched at targets behind the wall are deflected
upward and miss automatically. Boulders hurled by
Giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are
unaffected. Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass
through it.

Wish

Level 9 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: Action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous

Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By
simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.
The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other
spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you
don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that
spell, including costly components. The spell simply
takes effect.
Alternatively, you can create one of the following
effects of your choice:

175

Object Creation. You create one object of up to
25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The
object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that
you can see on the ground.
Instant Health. You allow yourself and up to
twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit
Points, and you end all effects on them listed in
the Greater Restoration spell.
Resistance. You grant up to ten creatures that you
can see Resistance to one damage type that you
choose. This Resistance is permanent.
Spell Immunity. You grant up to ten creatures you
can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.
Sudden Learning. You replace one of your feats with
another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all
the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of
the new one. You can’t replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.
Roll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forcing
a reroll of any die roll made within the last round
(including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to
accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish
spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a
foe’s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made
with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose
whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
Reshape Reality. You may wish for something not
included in any of the other effects. To do so, state
your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The
GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in
such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater
the likelihood that something goes wrong. This
spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might
be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an
unforeseen consequence as a result of how you
worded the wish. For example, wishing that a
villain were dead might propel you forward in
time to a period when that villain is no longer
alive, effectively removing you from the game.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or
an Artifact might instantly transport you to the
presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish
is granted and its effects have consequences for a
whole community, region, or world, you are likely
to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect
a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft
the wish in a particular way. If your wish would
undo the multiverse itself, your wish fails.

The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect
other than duplicating another spell weakens you.
After enduring that stress, each time you cast a
spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10
Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage
can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days.
For each of those days that you spend resting and
doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there
is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast
Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.

Word of Recall

Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 5 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous

You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet
of you instantly teleport to a previously designated
sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with
you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the
spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first
preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.
You must designate a location, such as a temple, as
a sanctuary by casting this spell there.

Zone of Truth

Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)
Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius Sphere centered on a
point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature
that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a
deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether
a creature succeeds or fails on this save.
An affected creature is aware of the spell and
can avoid answering questions to which it would
normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be
evasive yet must be truthful.

Rules Glossary
Glossary Conventions
The glossary uses the following conventions:

Tags in Brackets. Some entries have a tag in brackets after the entry’s name, as in “Attack [Action].”
A tag—Action, Area of Effect, Attitude, Condition,
or Hazard—indicates that a rule is part of a family
of rules. The tags also have glossary entries.
“You.” The game’s rules—in this glossary and elsewhere—often talk about something happening
to you in the game world. That “you” refers to
the creature or object that the rule applies to in a
particular moment of play. For example, the “you”
in the Prone condition is a creature that currently
has that condition.
“See Also.” Some glossary entries include a See also
section that points to other entries in the glossary,
to other parts of this document, or both.
No Obsolete Terms. The glossary contains definitions of current rules terms only. If you’re looking
for a term from an earlier version of the fifth edition rules, consult the index.

Rules Definitions
Here are definitions of various rules.

Ability Check

An ability check is a D20 Test that represents using
one of the six abilities—or a specific skill associated
with an ability—to overcome a challenge. See also
“Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests” and “Proficiency”).

Ability Score and Modifier

A creature has six ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma—each of which has a corresponding modifier. Add the modifier when you make a D20 Test
with the corresponding ability or when a rule asks
you to do so. See also “Playing the Game” (“The Six
Abilities”).

Action

On your turn, you can take one action. Choose which
action to take from those below or from the special
actions provided by your features. See also “Playing
the Game” (“Actions”). These actions are defined
elsewhere in this glossary:
Attack
Dash
Disengage

Dodge
Help
Hide

Influence
Magic
Ready

Search
Study
Utilize

Advantage
If you have Advantage on a D20 Test, roll two d20s,
and use the higher roll. A roll can’t be affected by
more than one Advantage, and Advantage and Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other. See
also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).

Adventure

An adventure is a series of encounters. A
story emerges through playing them. See also
“Encounter.”

Alignment

A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). These factors allow for nine possible combinations, such as Lawful
Good and Neutral Evil. See also “Character Creation”
(“Create Your Character”).

Ally

A creature is your ally if it is a member of your adventuring party, your friend, on your side in combat,
or a creature that the rules or the GM designates as
your ally.

Area of Effect

Attack Roll

The descriptions of many spells and other features
specify that they have an area of effect, which typically has one of six shapes. These shapes are defined elsewhere in this glossary:

An attack roll is a D20 Test that represents making
an attack with a weapon, an Unarmed Strike, or a
spell. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).

Cone
Cube

Cylinder
Emanation

Line
Sphere

An area of effect has a point of origin, a location
from which the effect’s energy erupts. The rules for
each shape specify how to position its point of origin. If all straight lines extending from the point of
origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked,
that location isn’t included in the area of effect.
To block a line, an obstruction must provide Total
Cover. See also “Cover.”
If the creator of an area of effect places it at an
unseen point and an obstruction—such as a wall—
is between the creator and that point, the point
of origin comes into being on the near side of the
obstruction.

Armor Class

An Armor Class (AC) is the target number for an
attack roll. AC represents how difficult it is to hit a
target.
Your base AC calculation is 10 plus your Dexterity
modifier. If a rule gives you another base AC calculation, you choose which calculation to use; you can’t
use more than one. See also “Attack Roll.”

Armor Training

Armor training allows you to use armor of a certain
category without the following drawbacks. If you
wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test
that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t
cast spells. If you use a Shield and lack training with
it, you don’t gain its AC bonus. See also “Disadvantage” and “Equipment” (“Armor”).

Attack [Action]

When you take the Attack action, you can make one
attack roll with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.
Equipping and Unequipping Weapons. You can
either equip or unequip one weapon when you make
an attack as part of this action. You do so either
before or after the attack. If you equip a weapon
before an attack, you don’t need to use it for that attack. Equipping a weapon includes drawing it from
a sheath or picking it up. Unequipping a weapon includes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it.
Moving between Attacks. If you move on your
turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that
gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack
action, you can use some or all of that movement to
move between those attacks.

177

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Attitude

A monster has a starting attitude toward a player
character: Friendly, Hostile, or Indifferent. See also
“Friendly,” “Hostile,” “Indifferent,” and “Influence.”

Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a
bond—called Attunement—with them before the
creature can use an item’s magical properties. A
creature can have Attunement with no more than
three magic items at a time. See also “Equipment”
(“Magic Items”).

Blinded [Condition]

While you have the Blinded condition, you experience the following effects.
Can’t See. You can’t see and automatically fail any
ability check that requires sight.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage.

Blindsight

If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific
range without relying on physical sight. Within that
range, you can see anything that isn’t behind Total
Cover even if you have the Blinded condition or are
in Darkness. Moreover, in that range, you can see
something that has the Invisible condition.

Bloodied

A creature is Bloodied while it has half its Hit Points
or fewer remaining.

Bonus Action

A Bonus Action is a special action that you can take
on the same turn that you take an action. You can’t
take more than one Bonus Action on a turn, and you
have a Bonus Action to take only if a rule explicitly
says so. See also “Playing the Game” (“Actions”).

Breaking Objects

Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some
spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceedingly fragile, the GM may allow a creature to break
it automatically with the Attack or Utilize action.
Armor Class. The Object Armor Class table suggests ACs for various substances.

Campaign

Hit Points. An object is destroyed when it has 0
Hit Points. The Object Hit Points table suggests Hit
Points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large
or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargantuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections,
and track each section’s Hit Points separately. The
GM determines whether destroying part of an object causes the whole thing to collapse.

4 (1d8)

18 (4d8)

Large (cart, dining table)

5 (1d10)

27 (5d10)

Damage Types and Objects. Objects have Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. The GM might
decide that some damage types are more or less effective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning
damage works well for smashing things but not for
cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnerability to Fire damage.
Damage Threshold. Big objects, such as castle
walls, often have extra resilience represented by a
damage threshold. See also “Damage Threshold.”
No Ability Scores. An object lacks ability scores
unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without
ability scores, an object can’t make ability checks,
and it fails all saving throws.

Bright Light

Bright Light is normal illumination. See also “Playing the Game” (“Exploration”).

Burning [Hazard]

A burning creature or object takes 1d4 Fire damage
at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you
can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself
the Prone condition and rolling on the ground.
The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or
suffocated.

Burrow Speed

A creature that has a Burrow Speed can use that
speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. The
creature can’t burrow through solid rock unless the
creature has a trait that allows it to do so. See also
“Speed.”

178

System Reference Document 5.2.1

A campaign is a series of adventures. See also
“Adventure.”

A cantrip is a level 0 spell, which is cast without a
spell slot. See also “Spells.”

Carrying Capacity

Your size and Strength score determine the maximum weight in pounds that you can carry, as shown
in the Carrying Capacity table. The table also shows
the maximum weight you can drag, lift, or push.
While dragging, lifting, or pushing weight in excess of the maximum weight you can carry, your
Speed can be no more than 5 feet.

Challenge Rating
Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a
monster poses to a group of four player characters.
Compare a monster’s CR to the characters’ level. If
the CR is higher, the monster is likely a danger. If the
CR is lower, the monster likely poses little threat.
But circumstances and the number of player characters can significantly alter how threatening a monster is in actual play. “Gameplay Toolbox” (“Combat
Encounters”) provides guidance to the GM on using
CR while planning potential combat encounters. See
also “Stat Block.”

Character Sheet

A character sheet is a paper or digital record that
you use to track your character’s information. See
also “Character Creation.”

Charmed [Condition]

While you have the Charmed condition, you experience the following effects.
Can’t Harm the Charmer. You can’t attack the
charmer or target the charmer with damaging abilities or magical effects.
Social Advantage. The charmer has Advantage on
any ability check to interact with you socially.

Climbing

While you’re climbing, each foot of movement costs
1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). You
ignore this extra cost if you have a Climb Speed and
use it to climb.

At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery surface or
one with few handholds might require a successful
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

Climb Speed

A Climb Speed can be used in place of Speed to traverse a vertical surface without expending the extra
movement normally associated with climbing. See
also “Climbing” and “Speed.”

Concentration

Some spells and other effects require Concentration
to remain active, as specified in their descriptions.
If the effect’s creator loses Concentration, the effect
ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the effect’s description specifies how long the creator can
concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some
other duration. The creator can end Concentration
at any time (no action required). The following factors break Concentration.
Another Concentration Effect. You lose Concentration on an effect the moment you start casting
a spell that requires Concentration or activate another effect that requires Concentration.
Damage. If you take damage, you must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken
(round down), whichever number is higher, up to a
maximum DC of 30.
Incapacitated or Dead. Your Concentration ends
if you have the Incapacitated condition or you die.

Condition

A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient,
and various rules define how to end a condition.
This glossary defines these conditions:
Blinded
Charmed
Deafened
Exhaustion
Frightened

Grappled
Incapacitated
Invisible
Paralyzed
Petrified

Poisoned
Prone
Restrained
Stunned
Unconscious

A condition doesn’t stack with itself; a recipient
either has a condition or doesn’t. The Exhaustion
condition is an exception to that rule.

Cone [Area of Effect]

179

A Cone is an area of effect that extends in straight
lines from a point of origin in a direction its creator
chooses. A Cone’s width at any point along its length
is equal to that point’s distance from the point of
origin. For example, a Cone is 15 feet wide at a point
along its length that is 15 feet from the point of
origin. The effect that creates a Cone specifies its
maximum length.
A Cone’s point of origin isn’t included in the area
of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Cover
Cover provides a degree of protection to a target
behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of
which provides a different benefit to a target: Half
Cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws),
Three-Quarters Cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws), and Total Cover (can’t be targeted directly). If behind more than one degree of
cover, a target benefits only from the most protective degree. See also “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).

Crawling

While you’re crawling, each foot of movement costs
1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). See
also “Speed.”

Creature

Any being in the game, including a player’s character, is a creature. See also “Creature Type.”

Creature Type

Every creature, including every player character,
has a tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature it is. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. These are the game’s creature types:
Aberration
Beast
Celestial
Construct
Dragon

Elemental
Fey
Fiend
Giant
Humanoid

Monstrosity
Ooze
Plant
Undead

The types don’t have rules themselves, but some
rules in the game affect creatures of certain types
in different ways.

Critical Hit

If you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, you
score a Critical Hit, and the attack hits regardless of
any modifiers or the target’s AC. A Critical Hit lets
you roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against
the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice
and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers. See also “Playing the Game” (“Damage and
Healing”).

Cube [Area of Effect]

A Cube is an area of effect that extends in straight
lines from a point of origin located anywhere on a
face of the Cube. The effect that creates a Cube specifies its size, which is the length of each side.
A Cube’s point of origin isn’t included in the area
of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

Curses

Some game effects curse a creature or an object.
The effect that confers a curse defines what the
curse does. Curses can be removed by the Remove
Curse and Greater Restoration spells or other magic
that explicitly ends curses.

Cylinder [Area of Effect]
A Cylinder is an area of effect that extends in
straight lines from a point of origin located at the
center of the circular top or bottom of the Cylinder.
The effect that creates a Cylinder specifies the radius of the Cylinder’s base and the Cylinder’s height.
A Cylinder’s point of origin is included in the area
of effect.

D20 Test

D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of
the game: ability checks, attack rolls, and saving
throws. If something in the game affects D20 Tests,
it affects all three of these rolls. The GM determines
whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circumstance. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).

Damage

Damage represents harm that causes a creature or
an object to lose Hit Points.

Damage Roll

A damage roll is a die roll, adjusted by any applicable modifiers, that deals damage to a target. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

Damage Threshold

A creature or an object that has a damage threshold has Immunity to all damage unless it takes an
amount of damage from a single attack or effect
equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in
which case it takes that entire instance of damage. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the
damage threshold is superficial and doesn’t reduce
Hit Points. For example, if an object has a damage
threshold of 10, the object takes no damage if 9
damage is dealt to it, since that damage fails to
exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 11
damage, it takes all of that damage.

Damage Types

Attacks and other harmful effects deal different
types of damage. Damage types have no rules of
their own, but other rules, such as Resistance, rely
on the types. The Damage Types table offers examples to help a GM assign a type to a new effect.

Darkness

An area of Darkness is Heavily Obscured. See
also “Heavily Obscured” and “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).

Darkvision

If you have Darkvision, you can see in Dim Light
within a specified range as if it were Bright Light
and in Darkness within that range as if it were
Dim Light. You discern colors in that Darkness
only as shades of gray. See also “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).

Dash [Action]

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra
movement for the current turn. The increase equals
your Speed after applying any modifiers. With a
Speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to
60 feet on your turn if you Dash. If your Speed of 30
feet is reduced to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet
this turn if you Dash.
If you have a special speed, such as a Fly Speed or
Swim Speed, you can use that speed instead of your
Speed when you take this action. You choose which
speed to use each time you take it. See also “Speed.”

Dead

A dead creature has no Hit Points and can’t regain
them unless it is first revived by magic such as the
Raise Dead or Revivify spell. When such a spell is
cast, the spirit knows who is casting it and can refuse. The spirit of a dead creature has left the body
and departed for the Outer Planes, and reviving the
creature requires calling the spirit back.
If the creature returns to life, the revival effect
determines the creature’s current Hit Points. Unless otherwise stated, the creature returns to life
with any conditions, magical contagions, or curses
that were affecting it at death if the durations of
those effects are still ongoing. If the creature died
with any Exhaustion levels, it returns with 1 fewer
level. If the creature had Attunement to one or more
magic items, it is no longer attuned to them.

Deafened [Condition]

Disadvantage

While you have the Deafened condition, you experience the following effect.
Can’t Hear. You can’t hear and automatically fail
any ability check that requires hearing.

If you have Disadvantage on a D20 Test, roll two
d20s and use the lower roll. A roll can’t be affected
by more than one Disadvantage, and Advantage and
Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other. See
also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).

Death Saving Throw

A player character must make a Death Saving
Throw (also called a Death Save) if they start their
turn with 0 Hit Points. See also “Playing the Game”
(“Damage and Healing”).

Dehydration [Hazard]

A creature requires an amount of water per day
based on its size, as shown in the Water Needs per
Day table. A creature that drinks less than half the
required water for a day gains 1 Exhaustion level
at the day’s end. Exhaustion caused by dehydration can’t be removed until the creature drinks the
full amount of water required for a day. See also
“Exhaustion.”

Difficult Terrain
If a space is Difficult Terrain, every foot of movement in that space costs 1 extra foot. For example,
moving 5 feet through Difficult Terrain costs 10 feet
of movement. Difficult Terrain isn’t cumulative; either a space is Difficult Terrain or it isn’t.
A space is Difficult Terrain if the space contains
any of the following or something similar:
• A creature that isn’t Tiny or your ally
• Furniture that is sized for creatures of your size or
larger
• Heavy snow, ice, rubble, or undergrowth
• Liquid that’s between shin- and waist-deep
• A narrow opening sized for a creature one size
smaller than you
• A slope of 20 degrees or more

Difficulty Class
A Difficulty Class (DC) is the target number for an
ability check or a saving throw. See also “Playing the
Game” (“D20 Tests”).

Dim Light

An area with Dim Light is Lightly Obscured. See
also “Lightly Obscured” and “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).

181

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Disengage [Action]

If you take the Disengage action, your movement
doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of
the current turn.

Dodge [Action]

If you take the Dodge action, you gain the following
benefits: until the start of your next turn, any attack
roll made against you has Disadvantage if you can
see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving
throws with Advantage.
You lose these benefits if you have the Incapacitated condition or if your Speed is 0.

Emanation [Area of Effect]

An Emanation is an area of effect that extends in
straight lines from a creature or an object in all directions. The effect that creates an Emanation specifies the distance it extends.
An Emanation moves with the creature or object
that is its origin unless it is an instantaneous or a
stationary effect.
An Emanation’s origin (creature or object) isn’t
included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

Encounter

An encounter is a scene in an adventure that is part
of at least one of the game’s three pillars: social interaction, exploration, or combat. See also “Playing
the Game” (“Social Interaction,” “Exploration,” and
“Combat”).

Enemy

A creature is your enemy if it fights against you in
combat, actively works to harm you, or is designated as your enemy by the rules or GM.

Exhaustion [Condition]

While you have the Exhaustion condition, you
experience the following effects.
Exhaustion Levels. This condition is cumulative.
Each time you receive it, you gain 1 Exhaustion
level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.
D20 Tests Affected. When you make a D20 Test,
the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.
Speed Reduced. Your Speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.
Removing Exhaustion Levels. Finishing a Long
Rest removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. When
your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.

Experience Points

Grappled [Condition]

As they overcome challenges and complete adventures, characters earn Experience Points (XP),
which are awarded by the Game Master. When a
character’s XP total crosses certain thresholds,
the character’s level increases. See also “Level
Advancement.”

While you have the Grappled condition, you experience the following effects.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. You have Disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than the grappler.
Movable. The grappler can drag or carry you
when it moves, but every foot of movement costs it 1
extra foot unless you are Tiny or two or more sizes
smaller than it.

Expertise

Expertise is a feature that enhances your use of a
skill proficiency. When you make an ability check
with a skill proficiency in which you have Expertise,
your Proficiency Bonus is doubled for that check unless the bonus is doubled by another feature.
If you gain Expertise, you gain it in one skill in
which you have proficiency. You can’t have Expertise in the same skill proficiency more than once.
See also “Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).

Falling [Hazard]

A creature that falls takes 1d6 Bludgeoning damage at the end of the fall for every 10 feet it fell, to
a maximum of 20d6. When the creature lands, it
has the Prone condition unless it avoids taking any
damage from the fall.
A creature that falls into water or another liquid
can use its Reaction to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the
surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any
damage resulting from the fall is halved.

Flying

A variety of effects allow a creature to fly. While flying, you fall if you have the Incapacitated or Prone
condition or your Fly Speed is reduced to 0. You can
stay aloft in those circumstances if you can hover.
See also “Falling” and “Fly Speed.”

Fly Speed

A Fly Speed can be used to travel through the air.
While you have a Fly Speed, you can stay aloft until
you land, fall, or die. See also “Flying” and “Speed.”

Friendly [Attitude]

A Friendly creature views you favorably. You
have Advantage on an ability check to influence a
Friendly creature. See also “Influence.”

Frightened [Condition]

While you have the Frightened condition, you experience the following effects.
Ability Checks and Attacks Affected. You have
Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls
while the source of fear is within line of sight.
Can’t Approach. You can’t willingly move closer to
the source of fear.

182

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Grappling

A creature can grapple another creature. Characters typically grapple by using an Unarmed Strike.
Many monsters have special attacks that allow
them to quickly grapple prey. However a grapple is
initiated, it follows these rules. See also “Unarmed
Strike” and “Grappled.”
Grappled Condition. Successfully grappling a
creature gives it the Grappled condition.
One Grapple per Hand. A creature must have a
hand free to grapple another creature. Some stat
blocks and game effects allow a creature to grapple
using a tentacle, a maw, or another body part. Whatever part a grappler uses, it can grapple only one
creature at a time with that part, and the grappler
can’t use that part to target another creature unless
it ends the grapple.
Ending a Grapple. A Grappled creature can use
its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the grapple’s escape
DC, ending the condition on itself on a success. The
condition also ends if the grappler has the Incapacitated condition or if the distance between the
Grappled target and the grappler exceeds the grapple’s range. In addition, the grappler can release the
target at any time (no action required).

Hazard

A hazard is an environmental danger. See also
“Burning,” “Dehydration,” “Falling,” “Malnutrition,”
and “Suffocation.”

Healing

Healing is how you regain Hit Points. See also “Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

Heavily Obscured

You have the Blinded condition while trying to see
something in a Heavily Obscured space. See also
“Blinded,” “Darkness,” and “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).

Help [Action]

When you take the Help action, you do one of the
following.
Assist an Ability Check. Choose one of your
skill or tool proficiencies and one ally who is near

enough for you to assist verbally or physically when
they make an ability check. That ally has Advantage
on the next ability check they make with the chosen
skill or tool. This benefit expires if the ally doesn’t
use it before the start of your next turn. The GM has
final say on whether your assistance is possible.
Assist an Attack Roll. You momentarily distract
an enemy within 5 feet of you, giving Advantage to
the next attack roll by one of your allies against that
enemy. This benefit expires at the start of your next
turn.

Heroic Inspiration

If you (a player character) have Heroic Inspiration,
you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new roll.
If you gain Heroic Inspiration but already have it,
it’s lost unless you give it to a player character who
lacks it.

Hide [Action]

With the Hide action, you try to hide yourself. To do
so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth)
check while you’re Heavily Obscured or behind
Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, and you must
be out of any enemy’s line of sight; if you can see a
creature, you can discern whether it can see you.
On a successful check, you have the Invisible condition while hidden. Make note of your check’s total,
which is the DC for a creature to find you with a
Wisdom (Perception) check.
You stop being hidden immediately after any of
the following occurs: you make a sound louder than
a whisper, an enemy finds you, you make an attack
roll, or you cast a spell with a Verbal component.

High Jump

When you make a High Jump, you leap into the
air a number of feet equal to 3 plus your Strength
modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least
10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When
you make a standing High Jump, you can jump only
half that distance. Either way, each foot of the jump
costs a foot of movement.
You can extend your arms half your height above
yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times
your height.

Hit Point Dice

Hit Point Dice, or Hit Dice for short, help determine
a player character’s Hit Point maximum, as explained in “Character Creation.” Most monsters also
have Hit Dice. A creature can spend Hit Dice during
a Short Rest to regain Hit Points. See also “Short
Rest.”

183

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Hit Points
Hit Points (HP) are a measure of how difficult it is
to kill or destroy a creature or an object. Damage
reduces Hit Points, and healing restores them.
You can’t have more Hit Points than your Hit Point
maximum, and you can’t have less than 0. See also
“Breaking Objects” and “Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

Hostile [Attitude]

A Hostile creature views you unfavorably. You have
Disadvantage on an ability check to influence a Hostile creature. See also “Influence.”

Hover

Some creatures can hover, as noted in their stat
blocks, and some spells and other effects grant the
ability to hover. Hovering while flying prevents
you from falling in certain circumstances. See also
“Flying.”

Illusions

Spells and other effects sometimes create magical illusions. Such an effect defines what the illusion does
and which senses or mental faculties it deceives.
If an illusion manifests in space, the illusion is
insubstantial and weightless, yet it seems to be
affected by the environment as if the illusion were
real unless the effect that created it specifies otherwise. For example, a visual illusion of a creature
casts shadows and reflections, and wind appears
to affect the illusory creature. Similarly, an audible
illusion echoes in an echoey space.

Immunity

If you have Immunity to a damage type or a condition, it doesn’t affect you in any way.

Improvised Weapons

An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a
makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg,
or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also
counts as an improvised weapon if it’s wielded in
a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged
weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Melee weapon that lacks the Thrown property, the
weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An improvised weapon follows the rules below.
Proficiency. Don’t add your Proficiency Bonus to
attack rolls with an improvised weapon.
Damage. On a hit, the weapon deals 1d4 damage
of a type the GM thinks is appropriate for the object.
Range. If you throw the weapon, it has a normal
range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
Weapon Equivalents. If an improvised weapon
resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the GM may
say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon’s rules. For example, the GM could treat a table
leg as a Club.

Incapacitated [Condition]

Initiative

While you have the Incapacitated condition, you experience the following effects.
Inactive. You can’t take any action, Bonus Action,
or Reaction.
No Concentration. Your Concentration is broken.
Speechless. You can’t speak.
Surprised. If you’re Incapacitated when you roll
Initiative, you have Disadvantage on the roll.

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. The combat rules in “Playing the Game” explain
how to roll Initiative.
Sometimes a GM might have combatants use
their Initiative scores instead of rolling Initiative.
Your Initiative score equals 10 plus your Dexterity
modifier. If you have Advantage on Initiative rolls,
increase your Initiative score by 5. If you have Disadvantage on those rolls, decrease that score by 5.
See also “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).

Indifferent [Attitude]

An Indifferent creature has no desire to help or hinder you. Indifferent is the default attitude of a monster. See also “Influence.”

Influence [Action]

With the Influence action, you urge a monster to
do something. Describe or roleplay how you’re
communicating with the monster. Are you trying to
deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The
GM then determines whether the monster feels willing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction;
this determination establishes whether an ability
check is necessary, as explained below.
Willing. If your urging aligns with the monster’s
desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster
fulfills your request in a way it prefers.
Unwilling. If your urging is repugnant to the monster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is
necessary; it doesn’t comply.
Hesitant. If you urge the monster to do something
that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability
check, which is affected by the monster’s attitude:
Indifferent, Friendly, or Hostile, each of which is
defined in this glossary. The Influence Checks table suggests which ability check to make based on
how you’re interacting with the monster. The GM
chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to
15 or the monster’s Intelligence score, whichever
is higher. On a successful check, the monster does
as urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours
(or a duration set by the GM) before urging it in the
same way again.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Invisible [Condition]

While you have the Invisible condition, you experience the following effects.
Surprise. If you’re Invisible when you roll Initiative, you have Advantage on the roll.
Concealed. You aren’t affected by any effect that
requires its target to be seen unless the effect’s creator can somehow see you. Any equipment you are
wearing or carrying is also concealed.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Disadvantage, and your attack rolls have Advantage. If a creature can somehow see you, you don’t
gain this benefit against that creature.

Jumping

When you jump, you make either a Long Jump (horizontal) or a High Jump (vertical). See also “Long
Jump” and “High Jump.”

Knocking Out a Creature

When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points
with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the
creature to 1 Hit Point. The creature then has the
Unconscious condition and starts a Short Rest.
The creature remains Unconscious until it regains
any Hit Points or until someone uses an action to
administer first aid to it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

Lightly Obscured

You have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks to see something in a Lightly Obscured
space. See also “Dim Light” and “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).

Line [Area of Effect]

A Line is an area of effect that extends from a point
of origin in a straight path along its length and covers an area defined by its width. The effect that creates a Line specifies its length and width.
A Line’s point of origin isn’t included in the area of
effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

Long Jump

When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally
a number of feet up to your Strength score if you

move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump.
When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap
only half that distance. Either way, each foot you
jump costs a foot of movement.
If you land in Difficult Terrain, you must succeed
on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or have the
Prone condition.
This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of
the jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a
stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a
low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s
distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise,
you hit the obstacle.

Long Rest

A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at
least 8 hours—available to any creature. During a
Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as
reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.
During sleep, you have the Unconscious condition.
After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least
16 hours before starting another one.
Benefits of the Rest. To start a Long Rest, you
must have at least 1 Hit Point. When you finish the
rest, you gain the following benefits:

Regain All HP. You regain all lost Hit Points and all
spent Hit Point Dice. If your Hit Point maximum
was reduced, it returns to normal.
Ability Scores Restored. If any of your ability
scores were reduced, they return to normal.
Exhaustion Reduced. If you have the Exhaustion
condition, its level decreases by 1.
Special Feature. Some features are recharged by a
Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges
in the way specified in its description.
Interrupting the Rest. A Long Rest is stopped by
the following interruptions:
•
•
•
•

Rolling Initiative
Casting a spell other than a cantrip
Taking any damage
1 hour of walking or other physical exertion

If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption,
you gain the benefits of a Short Rest. See also “Short
Rest.”
You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an
interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour per interruption to finish.

Magic [Action]

When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell
that has a casting time of an action or use a feature
or magic item that requires a Magic action to be
activated.

185

System Reference Document 5.2.1

If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 minute or longer, you must take the Magic action on
each turn of that casting, and you must maintain
Concentration while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a
spell slot. See also “Concentration.”

Magical Effect

An effect is magical if it is created by a spell, a magic
item, or a phenomenon that a rule labels as magical.

Malnutrition [Hazard]

A creature needs an amount of food per day based
on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day table. A creature that eats but consumes less than half
the required food for a day must succeed on a DC
10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion
level at the day’s end. A creature that eats nothing
for 5 days automatically gains 1 Exhaustion level at
the end of the fifth day as well as an additional level
at the end of each subsequent day without food.
Exhaustion caused by malnutrition can’t be removed until the creature eats the full amount of
food required for a day. See also “Exhaustion.”

Monster
A monster is a creature controlled by the GM, even
if the creature is benevolent. See also “Creature” and
“NPC.”

Nonplayer Character

A nonplayer character (NPC) is a monster that has
a personal name and a distinct personality. See also
“Monster.”

Object

An object is a nonliving, distinct thing. Composite
things, like buildings, comprise more than one object. See also “Breaking Objects.”

Occupied Space

A space is occupied if a creature is in it or if it is
completely filled by objects.

Opportunity Attacks

You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves your reach using its
action, its Bonus Action, its Reaction, or one of its
speeds. To make the Opportunity Attack, take a Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon or
an Unarmed Strike against the provoking creature.
The attack occurs right before the creature leaves
your reach. See also “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).

Paralyzed [Condition]

Poisoned [Condition]

While you have the Paralyzed condition, you experience the following effects.
Incapacitated. You have the Incapacitated
condition.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.
Automatic Critical Hits. Any attack roll that hits
you is a Critical Hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of
you.

While you have the Poisoned condition, you experience the following effect.
Ability Checks and Attacks Affected. You have
Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

Passive Perception

Passive Perception is a score that reflects a creature’s general awareness of its surroundings. The
GM uses this score when determining whether a
creature notices something without consciously
making a Wisdom (Perception) check.
A creature’s Passive Perception equals 10 plus the
creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check bonus. If the
creature has Advantage on such checks, increase
the score by 5. If the creature has Disadvantage on
them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level
1 character with a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in
Perception has a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 +
2). If that character has Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, the score becomes 19.

Per Day

If a rule says you can use something a certain number of times per day, that means you must finish a
Long Rest to use it again after you run out of uses.

Petrified [Condition]

While you have the Petrified condition, you experience the following effects.
Turned to Inanimate Substance. You are transformed, along with any nonmagical objects you are
wearing and carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Your weight increases by a
factor of ten, and you cease aging.
Incapacitated. You have the Incapacitated
condition.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Resist Damage. You have Resistance to all
damage.
Poison Immunity. You have Immunity to the Poisoned condition.

Player Character

A player character is a character controlled by a
player. See also “Character Creation.”

186

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Possession

Some effects cause a creature to be possessed by
another creature or entity. A possessing effect defines how the possession operates. Possession can
be prevented by the Protection from Evil and Good
spell and ended by the Dispel Evil and Good spell.

Proficiency

If you have proficiency with something, you can add
your Proficiency Bonus to any D20 Test you make
using that thing. A creature might have proficiency
in a skill or saving throw or with a weapon or tool.
See also “Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).

Prone [Condition]

While you have the Prone condition, you experience
the following effects.
Restricted Movement. Your only movement options are to crawl or to spend an amount of movement equal to half your Speed (round down) to
right yourself and thereby end the condition. If your
Speed is 0, you can’t right yourself.
Attacks Affected. You have Disadvantage on attack rolls. An attack roll against you has Advantage
if the attacker is within 5 feet of you. Otherwise,
that attack roll has Disadvantage.

Reach

A creature has a reach of 5 feet unless a rule says
otherwise.

Reaction

A Reaction is a special action taken in response to
a trigger defined in the Reaction’s description. You
can take a Reaction on another creature’s turn, and
if you take it on your turn, you can do so even if you
also take an action, a Bonus Action, or both. Once
you take a Reaction, you can’t take another one
until the start of your next turn. The Opportunity
Attack is a Reaction available to all creatures. See
also “Opportunity Attacks” and “Playing the Game”
(“Actions”).

Ready [Action]

You take the Ready action to wait for a particular
circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this
action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a
Reaction before the start of your next turn.
First, you decide what perceivable circumstance
will trigger your Reaction. Then, you choose the
action you will take in response to that trigger, or
you choose to move up to your Speed in response
to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the

trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the
zombie steps next to me, I move away.”
When the trigger occurs, you can either take your
Reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore
the trigger.
When you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (expending any resources used to cast it) but hold its
energy, which you release with your Reaction when
the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have
a casting time of an action, and holding on to the
spell’s magic requires Concentration, which you can
maintain up to the start of your next turn. If your
Concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect.

Resistance

If you have Resistance to a damage type, damage
of that type is halved against you (round down).
Resistance is applied only once to an instance of
damage. See also “Playing the Game” (“Damage and
Healing”).

Restrained [Condition]

While you have the Restrained condition, you experience the following effects.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage.
Saving Throws Affected. You have Disadvantage
on Dexterity saving throws.

Ritual

If you have a spell prepared that has the Ritual tag,
you can cast that spell as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than
normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which
means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a
higher level. See also “Spells.”

Round Down

Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the
game, round down if you end up with a fraction,
even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some
rules make an exception and tell you to round up.

Save

Save is another name for a saving throw. See also
“Saving Throw.”

Saving Throw

187

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an
attempt to avoid or resist a threat. You normally
make a saving throw only when a rule requires you
to do so, but you can decide to fail the save without
rolling. The result of a save is detailed in the effect
that allowed it. If a target is forced to make a save
and lacks the ability score used by it, the target automatically fails. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20
Tests”).

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Search [Action]
When you take the Search action, you make a Wisdom check to discern something that isn’t obvious.
The Search table suggests which skills are applicable when you take this action, depending on what
you’re trying to detect.

Search
Skill

Thing to Detect

Insight

Creature’s state of mind

Medicine

Creature’s ailment or cause of death

Perception

Concealed creature or object

Survival

Tracks or food

Shape-Shifting

If an effect, such as Wild Shape or the Polymorph
spell, lets you shape-shift, its description specifies
what happens to you. Unless that description says
otherwise, any ongoing effects on you—conditions,
spells, curses, and the like—carry over from one
form to the other. You revert to your true form if
you die.

Short Rest

A Short Rest is a 1-hour period of downtime, during
which a creature does nothing more strenuous than
reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. To start
a Short Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Point.
Benefits of the Rest. When you finish the rest, you
gain the following benefits:
Spend Hit Point Dice. You can spend one or more
of your Hit Point Dice to regain Hit Points. For
each Hit Point Die you spend in this way, roll the
die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You
regain Hit Points equal to the total (minimum of 1
Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional
Hit Point Die after each roll.
Special Feature. Some features are recharged by a
Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges
in the way specified in its description.
Interrupting the Rest. A Short Rest is stopped by
the following interruptions:
• Rolling Initiative
• Casting a spell other than a cantrip
• Taking any damage

An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits.

Simultaneous Effects

If two or more things happen at the same time on a
turn, the person at the game table—player or GM—
whose turn it is decides the order in which those
things happen. For example, if two effects occur at
the start of a player character’s turn, the player decides which of the effects happens first.

Size

Sphere [Area of Effect]

A creature or an object belongs to a size category:
Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan.
A creature’s size determines how much space the
creature occupies in combat. An object’s size affects
its Hit Points. See also “Breaking Objects” and “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).

A Sphere is an area of effect that extends in straight
lines from a point of origin outward in all directions. The effect that creates a Sphere specifies the
distance it extends as the radius of the Sphere.
A Sphere’s point of origin is included in the
Sphere’s area of effect.

Skill

A skill is an area of specialization associated with
an ability check. If you have proficiency in a skill,
you can add your Proficiency Bonus when you make
an ability check associated with that skill. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).

Speed

A creature has a Speed, which is the distance in feet
the creature can cover when it moves on its turn.
See also “Climbing,” “Crawling,” “Flying,” “Jumping,”
“Swimming” and “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).
Special Speeds. Some creatures have special
speeds, such as a Burrow Speed, Climb Speed, Fly
Speed, or Swim Speed, each of which is defined
in this glossary. If you have more than one speed,
choose which one to use when you move; you can
switch between the speeds during your move.
Whenever you switch, subtract the distance already
moved from the new speed. The result determines
how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or
less, you can’t use the new speed during the current
move. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 and a
Fly Speed of 40, you could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet,
and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more.
Changes to Your Speeds. If an effect increases or
decreases your Speed for a time, any special speed
you have increases or decreases by an equal amount
for the same duration. For example, if your Speed
is reduced to 0 and you have a Climb Speed, your
Climb Speed is also reduced to 0. Similarly, if your
Speed is halved and you have a Fly Speed, your Fly
Speed is also halved.

Spell

A spell is a magical effect that has the characteristics described in “Spells.”

Spell Attack

A spell attack is an attack roll made as part of a spell
or another magical effect. See also “Spells” (“Casting
Spells”).

Spellcasting Focus

A Spellcasting Focus is an object that certain creatures can use in place of a spell’s Material components if those materials aren’t consumed by the
spell and don’t have a cost specified. Some classes
allow its members to use certain types of Spellcasting Focuses. See also “Spells” (“Casting Spells”).

188

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Stable

A creature is Stable if it has 0 Hit Points but isn’t
required to make Death Saving Throws. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

Stat Block

A stat block contains the game statistics of a monster. Each stat block includes the following information presented after the monster’s name.
Size. A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large,
Huge, or Gargantuan. See also “Size.”
Creature Type. This entry notes the family of beings a monster belongs to, along with any descriptive tags. See also “Creature Type.”
Alignment. An alignment is suggested for the
monster, with the GM determining its actual alignment. See also “Alignment.”
AC, Initiative, and HP. These entries give the
monster’s Armor Class, Initiative, and Hit Points,
which are detailed in “Playing the Game.” In parentheses after the Hit Points, the monster’s Hit Point
Dice are provided, along with the contribution of its
Constitution, if any, to its Hit Points. Following the
Initiative modifier is an Initiative score. Some creatures that are created by magic lack Hit Dice and
Initiative information.
Speed. Here the monster’s Speed is provided,
along with any special speeds. See also “Burrow
Speed,” “Climb Speed,” “Fly Speed,” and “Swim
Speed.”
Ability Scores. A table provides the monster’s
ability scores, modifiers, and saving throw modifiers, all of which are detailed in “Playing the Game.”
Skills. This entry lists the monster’s skill proficiencies, if any. See also “Playing the Game”
(“Proficiency”).
Resistances and Vulnerabilities. These entries
list the monster’s Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if
any. See also “Resistance” and “Vulnerability.”
Immunities. This section lists the monster’s
damage and condition Immunities, if any. See also
“Immunity.”
Gear. If the monster has any equipment that can
be given away or retrieved, it’s listed in this entry.
Senses. This entry lists the monster’s special
senses, such as Darkvision, and its Passive Perception. See also “Passive Perception.”
Languages. This entry lists any languages the
monster knows.

CR. Challenge Rating summarizes the threat a
monster poses and is detailed in “Monsters.” The
Experience Points characters receive for defeating
a monster and its Proficiency Bonus follow. Some
creatures that are created by magic have no CR. See
also “Challenge Rating” and “Experience Points.”
Traits. The monster’s traits, if any, are features
that are active at all times or in certain situations.
Actions. The monster can take these actions in
addition to those detailed in this glossary. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Actions”).
Bonus Actions. If the monster has Bonus Action
options, they are listed in this section.
Reactions. If the monster can take special Reactions, those are listed in this section.
Attack Notation. The entry for a monster’s attack
starts by identifying whether the attack is a melee
or a ranged attack and then provides the attack
roll’s bonus, its reach or range, and what happens
on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its
entry says otherwise.
Saving Throw Effect Notation. If an effect forces
a saving throw, the effect’s entry starts by identifying the kind of saving throw required and then provides the save’s DC, a description of which creatures
must make the save, and what happens on a failed
or a successful save.
Damage Notation. A stat block usually provides
both a static number and a die expression for each
instance of damage. For example, an attack might
deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. The GM determines whether you use the static number or the die
expression in parentheses; you don’t use both.

Study [Action]

When you take the Study action, you make an Intelligence check to study your memory, a book, a clue,
or another source of knowledge and call to mind an
important piece of information about it.
The Areas of Knowledge table suggests which
skills are applicable to various areas of knowledge.

Areas of Knowledge
Skill

Areas

Arcana

Spells, magic items, eldritch symbols,
magical traditions, planes of existence,
and certain creatures (Aberrations,
Constructs, Elementals, Fey, and
Monstrosities)

History

Historic events and people, ancient
civilizations, wars, and certain creatures
(Giants and Humanoids)

Investigation

Traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry

Nature

Terrain, flora, weather, and certain
creatures (Beasts, Dragons, Oozes, and
Plants)

Religion

Deities, religious hierarchies and rites,
holy symbols, cults, and certain creatures (Celestials, Fiends, and Undead)

Stunned [Condition]
While you have the Stunned condition, you experience the following effects.
Incapacitated. You have the Incapacitated
condition.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.

Suffocation [Hazard]

A creature can hold its breath for a number of
minutes equal to 1 plus its Constitution modifier
(minimum of 30 seconds) before suffocation begins.
When a creature runs out of breath or is choking,
it gains 1 Exhaustion level at the end of each of
its turns. When a creature can breathe again, it
removes all levels of Exhaustion it gained from
suffocating.

Surprise

If a creature is caught unawares by the start of
combat, that creature is surprised, which causes it
to have Disadvantage on its Initiative roll. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Combat”).

Swimming

While you’re swimming, each foot of movement
costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain).
You ignore this extra cost if you have a Swim Speed
and use it to swim. At the GM’s option, moving any
distance in rough water might require a successful
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

Swim Speed

189

System Reference Document 5.2.1

A Swim Speed can be used to swim without expending the extra movement normally associated with
swimming. See also “Swimming” and “Speed.”

Target

Tremorsense

A target is the creature or object targeted by an
attack roll, forced to make a saving throw by an
effect, or selected to receive the effects of a spell or
another phenomenon.

A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it is detecting are both in
contact with the same surface (such as the ground,
a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.
Tremorsense can’t detect creatures or objects in
the air, and it doesn’t count as a form of sight.

Telepathy

Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature
to communicate mentally with another creature
within a specified range. Unless a rule states otherwise, the contacted creature doesn’t need to share a
language with the telepath to understand this communication, but the contacted creature must be able
to understand at least one language or be telepathic
itself to understand.
A telepath doesn’t need to see a contacted creature, and the telepath can start or end the telepathic
contact at any time (no action required). Telepathic
contact can’t be initiated and is immediately broken
if either the telepath or the other creature has the
Incapacitated condition. Telepathic contact is also
broken if the contacted creature is no longer within
the telepathy’s range or if the telepath contacts a
different creature within range.
A creature without telepathy can receive telepathic messages but can’t initiate a telepathic conversation. Once a telepathic conversation starts,
the non-telepath can communicate mentally to the
telepath until the telepathic connection ends.

Teleportation

Teleportation is a special kind of magical transportation. If you teleport, you disappear and reappear
elsewhere instantly, without moving through the
intervening space. This transportation doesn’t expend movement unless a rule tells you otherwise,
and teleportation never provokes Opportunity
Attacks.
When you teleport, all the equipment you’re
wearing and carrying teleports with you. If you’re
touching another creature when you teleport, that
creature doesn’t teleport with you unless the teleportation effect says otherwise.
If the destination space of your teleportation is
occupied by another creature or blocked by a solid
obstacle, you instead appear in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice.
The description of a teleportation effect tells you
if you must see the teleportation’s destination.

Temporary Hit Points

Temporary Hit Points are granted by certain effects
and act as a buffer against losing real Hit Points. See
also “Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

190

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Truesight

If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced
within a specified range. Within that range, your
vision pierces through the following:

Darkness. You can see in normal and magical
Darkness.
Invisibility. You see creatures and objects that have
the Invisible condition.
Visual Illusions. Visual illusions appear transparent to you, and you automatically succeed on saving throws against them.
Transformations. You discern the true form of any
creature or object you see that has been transformed by magic.
Ethereal Plane. You see into the Ethereal Plane.

Unarmed Strike

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack,
you can use a punch, kick, headbutt, or similar
forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed
Strike—a melee attack that involves you using your
body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5
feet of you.
Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose
one of the following options for its effect.
Damage. You make an attack roll against the
target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength
modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the
target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus
your Strength modifier.
Grapple. The target must succeed on a Strength
or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or it
has the Grappled condition. The DC for the saving
throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your
Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one
size larger than you and if you have a hand free to
grab it. See also “Grappling.”
Shove. The target must succeed on a Strength or
Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone
condition. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus
your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This
shove is possible only if the target is no more than
one size larger than you.

Unconscious [Condition]
While you have the Unconscious condition, you experience the following effects.
Inert. You have the Incapacitated and Prone
conditions, and you drop whatever you’re holding.
When this condition ends, you remain Prone.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Automatic Critical Hits. Any attack roll that hits
you is a Critical Hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of
you.
Unaware. You’re unaware of your surroundings.

Unoccupied Space

A space is unoccupied if no creatures are in it and it
isn’t completely filled by objects.

Utilize [Action]

You normally interact with an object while doing
something else, such as when you draw a sword as
part of the Attack action. When an object requires
an action for its use, you take the Utilize action.

Vulnerability

If you have Vulnerability to a damage type, damage
of that type is doubled against you. Vulnerability is
applied only once to an instance of damage. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

Weapon

A weapon is an object that is in the Simple or
Martial weapon category. See also “Equipment”
(“Weapons”).

Weapon Attack

A weapon attack is an attack roll made with a
weapon. See also “Weapon.”

191

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Gameplay Toolbox
Travel Pace
A group of characters can travel overland at a Normal, Fast, or Slow pace, as described in “Playing the
Game.” During any journey stage, the predominant
terrain determines the characters’ maximum travel
pace, as shown in the Maximum Pace column of the
Travel Terrain table. Certain factors can affect a
group’s travel pace.

Good Roads

The presence of a good road increases the group’s
maximum pace by one step (from Slow to Normal or
from Normal to Fast).

Slower Travelers

The group must move at a Slow pace if any group
member’s Speed is reduced to half or less of normal.

Extended Travel

Characters can push themselves to travel for more
than 8 hours per day, at the risk of tiring. At the end
of each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours,
each character must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 10
plus 1 for each hour past 8 hours.

Special Movement

If a party can travel at a high Speed for an extended
time, as with a spell such as Wind Walk or a magic
item such as a Carpet of Flying, translate the party’s
Speed into travel rates using these rules:

Miles per hour = Speed ÷ 10
Miles per day (Normal pace) = Miles per hour
× number of hours traveled (typically 8)
Fast pace = Miles per day × 1⅓ (round down)
Slow pace = Miles per day × 2/3 (round down)

If the characters are flying or their special movement allows them to ignore Difficult Terrain, they
can move at a Fast pace regardless of the terrain.

Vehicles

Characters traveling in a vehicle use the vehicle’s
speed in miles per hour (as shown in “Equipment”)
to determine their rate of travel, and they don’t
choose a travel pace.

Creating a Background

A character’s background represents what the character did prior to becoming an adventurer. Creating
a unique background or customizing an existing
one can reflect the particular theme of your campaign or elements of your world. You can also create
a background to help a player craft the story they
have in mind for their character.
This section describes, step by step, how you can
create backgrounds tailored for your world and the
heroes in it.

1: Choose Abilities

Choose three abilities that seem appropriate for the
background:
Strength or Dexterity. These abilities are ideal for
a background involving physical exertion.
Constitution. This ability is ideal for a background
that involves endurance or long hours of activity.

Intelligence or Wisdom. One or both abilities are
ideal for a background that focuses on cerebral or
spiritual matters.
Charisma. This ability is ideal for a background
that involves performance or social interaction.

2: Choose a Feat

Choose one feat from the Origin category. See “Origin Feats” for examples of Origin feats.

3: Choose Skill Proficiencies

Choose two skills appropriate for the background.
There needn’t be a relationship between the skill
proficiencies a background grants and the ability
scores it increases.

4: Choose a Tool Proficiency

Choose one tool used in the practice of the background or often associated with it.

5: Choose Equipment

Assemble a package of equipment worth 50 GP (including unspent gold). Don’t include Martial weapons or armor, as characters get them from their
class choices.

Curses and
Magical Contagions

A curse is a magical burden that lasts for a specified
time or until it is ended by some means. A magical
contagion is an adverse effect of magical origin that
is contagious by definition.
The following sections discuss curses and magical
contagions in detail.

Curses

A curse typically takes one of the forms detailed
below.

Bestow Curse

The simplest curses are created by the Bestow Curse
spell. The effects of such curses are limited and can
be ended by the Remove Curse spell.
Bestow Curse provides useful benchmarks for
gauging the potency of other curses. A curse that
lasts for 1 minute equates to a level 3 spell, while
one that lasts until dispelled equates to a level 9
spell.

Cursed Creatures

Some monsters are associated with curses, whether
as part of their origins or due to their ability to
spread curses—werewolves being a prime example.

193

System Reference Document 5.2.1

You decide how a spell like Remove Curse affects
a creature with accursed origins. For example, you
might decide that a mummy was created through a
curse and it can be destroyed permanently only by
casting Remove Curse on its corpse.

Cursed Magic Items

Cursed magic items are created deliberately or
originate as the result of supernatural events. Such
items are detailed in “Magic Items.”

Narrative Curses

A curse might manifest during an adventure when
a creature’s violation of a taboo warrants supernatural punishment, such as breaking a vow, defiling a
tomb, or murdering an innocent. Such a curse can
have any effects you design, or it might be a customized version of another type of curse discussed in
this section.
A creature affected by such a curse should know
why they’re being punished and be able to learn
how to end their curse, likely by symbolically
righting the wrong they committed. How a spell
like Remove Curse affects a curse that’s part of your
adventure is up to you—the spell might merely suppress the effects of the curse for a time. Regardless,
narrative curses should feel like rare, potent magic
rooted in the lore of your campaign.

Environmental Curses

Some locations are so suffused with evil that anyone who lingers there is burdened with a curse.
Demonic Possession is one example of an environmental curse.
Demonic Possession. Demonic Possession arises
from the chaos and evil of the Abyss and commonly
besets creatures that interact with demonic objects
or linger in desecrated locations, where demonic
spirits await victims.
A creature that becomes the target of Demonic
Possession must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by a bodiless demonic
entity. Whenever the possessed creature rolls a 1
on a D20 Test, the demonic entity takes control of
the creature and determines the creature’s behavior thereafter. At the end of each of the possessed
creature’s later turns, the creature makes a DC 15
Charisma saving throw, regaining control of itself
on a success.
After finishing a Long Rest, a creature with Demonic Possession makes a DC 15 Charisma saving
throw. On a successful save, the effect ends on the
creature. A Dispel Evil and Good spell or any magic
that removes a curse also ends the effect on it.

Magical Contagions
Alchemists, potion brewers, and areas of wild magic
are credited with creating the first magical contagions. An outbreak of such a contagion can form
the basis of an adventure as characters search for a
cure and try to stop the contagion’s spread.

Rest and Recuperation

If a creature infected with a magical contagion
spends 3 days recuperating—engaging in no
activities that would interrupt a Long Rest—the
creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw
at the end of the recuperation period. On a successful save, the creature has Advantage on saving
throws to fight off the magical contagion for the
next 24 hours.

Example Contagions

The following examples show how magical contagions can work. Feel free to alter the saving throw
DCs, effects, and other characteristics of these contagions to suit your campaign.

Cackle Fever

Magical Contagion

Cheaply made potions and elixirs are sometimes
tainted by Cackle Fever, which affects Humanoids
only (gnomes are strangely immune). A creature suffers the following effects 1d4 days after
infection:

Fever. The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level, which
lasts until the contagion ends on the creature.
Uncontrollable Laughter. While the creature has
the Exhaustion condition, the creature makes
a DC 13 Constitution saving throw each time it
takes damage other than Psychic damage. On a
failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) Psychic
damage and has the Incapacitated condition as
it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its
turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the
effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.

Fighting the Contagion. At the end of each Long
Rest, an infected creature makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. After the creature succeeds on
three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and
the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year.
Spreading the Contagion. Any Humanoid (other
than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot
Emanation originating from a creature infected
with Cackle Fever must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with
the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid
can’t catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.

194

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Sewer Plague

Magical Contagion
Fouled potions and alchemical waste can give rise
to Sewer Plague, which incubates in sewers and
refuse heaps and is sometimes transmitted by
creatures that dwell in such areas, including otyughs and rats. Any Humanoid that is wounded by a
creature that carries the contagion or that comes
into contact with contaminated filth or offal must
succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with Sewer Plague. A creature suffers
the following effects 1d4 days after infection:
Fatigue. The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level.
Weakness. While the creature has any Exhaustion
levels, it regains only half the normal number of
Hit Points from spending Hit Point Dice.
Restlessness. While the creature has any Exhaustion levels, finishing a Long Rest neither restores
lost Hit Points nor reduces the creature’s Exhaustion level.

Fighting the Contagion. Daily at dawn, an infected creature makes a DC 11 Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 Exhaustion level as its fatigue worsens. On a successful save, the creature’s Exhaustion level decreases
by 1. If the creature’s Exhaustion level is reduced to
0, the contagion ends on the creature.

Sight Rot

Magical Contagion

Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted
by Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or have the Blinded condition until the
contagion ends.
Fighting the Contagion. Magic such as a Heal or
Lesser Restoration spell ends the contagion immediately. A character who is proficient with an Herbalism Kit can use it to create one dose of nonmagical
ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the
eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the ointment suppresses the contagion on that creature for
24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way
for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and
applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on
the creature.
Spreading the Contagion. Any Humanoid that
makes skin contact with a creature infected with
Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can’t
catch the contagion from that particular infected
creature for the next 24 hours.

Environmental Effects
Deep Water

Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet
deep) presents additional challenges because of the
water’s pressure and cold temperature. After each
hour of swimming in deep water, a creature that
lacks a Swim Speed must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level.

Extreme Cold

When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or
lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must
succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at
the end of each hour or gain 1 Exhaustion level.
Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Cold
damage automatically succeed on the save.

Extreme Heat

When the temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or
higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and
without access to drinkable water must succeed on
a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour
or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 5 for the first
hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.
Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have
Disadvantage on the save. Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Fire damage automatically
succeed on the save.

Frigid Water

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a
number of minutes equal to its Constitution score
before suffering any ill effects. Each additional
minute spent in frigid water requires the creature
to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or
gain 1 Exhaustion level. Creatures with Resistance
or Immunity to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally
adapted to living in ice-cold water.

195

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Heavy Precipitation
Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy
snowfall is Lightly Obscured, and creatures in the
area have Disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception)
checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.

High Altitude

Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above
sea level is taxing for most creatures because of the
reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such
a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts
as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long
that creature can travel (see “Travel Pace”).
Creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation.
Creatures can’t become acclimated to elevations
above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such
environments.

Slippery Ice

Slippery ice is Difficult Terrain. A creature that
moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn
or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.

Strong Wind

Strong wind imposes Disadvantage on ranged attack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open
flames and disperses fog. A flying creature in a
strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.
A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm
that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks.

Thin Ice

Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds
per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight
on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice
in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall
through. Below the ice is frigid water (see “Frigid
Water” above).

Fear and Mental Stress

Mental Stress Effects

Due to the nature of their vocation, adventurers
tend to be less susceptible to fear and mental stress
than common folk. Whereas a farmer might flee in
terror from a bear or an apparition, adventurers are
made of sterner stuff. That said, certain creatures
and game effects can terrify or fray the mind of
even the most stalwart adventurer.
If you plan to use any of these rules, discuss them
with your players at the start of the campaign.

Fear Effects

Whenever the characters encounter something that
is supernaturally frightful, use the Frightened condition as the baseline effect. Fear effects typically
require a Wisdom saving throw, with a save DC
based on how terrifying the situation is. The Sample
Fear DCs table provides some examples.

Sample Fear DCs
Example

Save DC

When the characters open a sarcophagus, a
harmless yet terrifying apparition appears.

10

A character triggers a magical trap that
creates an illusory manifestation of that
character’s worst fears, visible only to that
character.

15

A portal to the Abyss opens, revealing a
nightmarish realm of torment and slaughter.

20

Typically, a Frightened creature repeats the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
At your discretion, a Frightened creature might
be subject to other effects as long as the Frightened
condition lasts. Consider these examples:

• The Frightened creature must take the Dash action on each of its turns and uses its movement to
get farther away from the source of its fear.
• Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have
Advantage.
• The Frightened creature can do only one of the
following on each of its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.

196

System Reference Document 5.2.1

When a character is subjected to an effect that
causes intense mental stress, Psychic damage is the
best way to emulate that effect.
The Sample Mental Stress Effects table provides a
few examples of such effects, with suggested saving
throw DCs and damage. Mental stress can usually
be resisted with a successful Wisdom save, but
sometimes an Intelligence or Charisma save is more
appropriate. On a successful save, a character might
take half as much damage instead of no damage, at
your discretion.

Sample Mental Stress Effects

Save

Psychic
Damage

A character ingests a hallucinogenic
substance that distorts the character’s perception of reality.

character’s next turn.

20

9d6

Example

Prolonged Effects
Exposure to mental stress can cause prolonged effects. Consider the following possibilities.
Short-Term Effects. The character has the Frightened, Incapacitated, or Stunned condition for 1d10
minutes. This condition might be accompanied by
alarming behavior or hallucinations. These effects
can be suppressed with the Calm Emotions spell or
removed by the Lesser Restoration spell.
Long-Term Effects. The character has Disadvantage on some or all ability checks for 1d10 × 10
hours, stemming from an unwillingness or inability
to exert a particular set of abilities. The character
might feel enervated and unable to exert much
Strength, for example, or become so suspicious of
others that Charisma checks are more difficult.
These effects can be suppressed with the Calm
Emotions spell or removed by the Lesser Restoration
spell.
Indefinite Effects. An indefinite effect is a longterm effect (see above) that lasts until removed by a
Greater Restoration spell. It can be suppressed by a
Calm Emotions spell.

Poison
Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are
a favorite tool among assassins and evil creatures.
Poisons come in the following four types:

Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an
object and remains potent until it is touched or
washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.
Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose
of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose
can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such
as allowing Advantage on the saving throw or
dealing only half as much damage on a failed save.
Inhaled. Poisonous powders and gases take effect
when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing
the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its
effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately
afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective
against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
Injury. Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus
Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or
similar object. The poison remains potent until
delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from
an object coated with the poison is exposed to its
effects.

Purchasing Poison

In some settings, laws prohibit the possession and
use of poison, but an illicit dealer or unscrupulous
apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters
with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poison easily. Other characters might have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before they acquire
the poison they seek.

Harvesting Poison

A character can attempt to harvest poison from a
venomous creature that is dead or has the Incapacitated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes, after
which the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence
(Nature) check using a Poisoner’s Kit. On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison
for a single dose, and no additional poison can be
harvested from that creature. On a failed check,
the character is unable to extract any poison. If the
character fails the check by 5 or more, the character
is subjected to the creature’s poison.

Sample Poisons
Example poisons are detailed here in alphabetical
order. Each poison’s description includes the suggested price for a single dose of the poison, its type
(contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury), and a description of the poison’s debilitating effects.

Assassin’s Blood (150 GP)
Ingested Poison

A creature subjected to Assassin’s Blood makes a
DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature takes 6 (1d12) Poison damage and has
the Poisoned condition for 24 hours. On a successful
save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

Burnt Othur Fumes (500 GP)
Inhaled Poison

A creature subjected to Burnt Othur Fumes must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or
take 10 (3d6) Poison damage, and it must repeat the
save at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6) Poison
damage. After three successful saves, the poison
ends.

Crawler Mucus (200 GP)
Contact Poison

A creature subjected to Crawler Mucus must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have
the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. The creature
also has the Paralyzed condition while Poisoned in
this way. The creature repeats the save at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success.

Essence of Ether (300 GP)
Inhaled Poison

A creature subjected to Essence of Ether must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have
the Poisoned condition for 8 hours. The creature
also has the Unconscious condition while Poisoned
in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake
it awake.

Malice (250 GP)
Inhaled Poison

A creature subjected to Malice must succeed on a
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. The creature also has
the Blinded condition while Poisoned in this way.

Midnight Tears (1,500 GP)
Ingested Poison

A creature that ingests Midnight Tears suffers no
effect until the stroke of midnight. Any effect that

197

System Reference Document 5.2.1

ends the Poisoned condition neutralizes this poison. If the poison hasn’t been neutralized before
midnight, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) Poison damage on a
failed save or half as much damage on a successful
one.

Oil of Taggit (400 GP)
Contact Poison

A creature subjected to Oil of Taggit must succeed
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the
Poisoned condition for 24 hours. The creature also
has the Unconscious condition while Poisoned in
this way. It wakes up if it takes damage.

Pale Tincture (250 GP)
Ingested Poison

A creature subjected to Pale Tincture must succeed
on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3
(1d6) Poison damage and have the Poisoned condition. The Poisoned creature repeats the save every
24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage on a failed
save. The damage the poison deals can’t be healed
by any means while the creature remains Poisoned.
After seven successful saves against the poison, the
creature is no longer Poisoned.

Purple Worm Poison (2,000 GP)
Injury Poison

A creature subjected to Purple Worm Poison makes
a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 (10d6)
Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Serpent Venom (200 GP)
Injury Poison

A creature subjected to Serpent Venom must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking

198

System Reference Document 5.2.1

10 (3d6) Poison damage on a failed save or half as
much damage on a successful one.

Spider’s Sting (200 GP)
Injury Poison

A creature subjected to Spider’s Sting must succeed
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the
Poisoned condition for 1 hour. If the creature fails
the save by 5 or more, the creature also has the Unconscious condition while Poisoned in this way. The
creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another
creature takes an action to shake it awake.

Torpor (600 GP)
Ingested Poison

A creature subjected to Torpor poison must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the
Poisoned condition for 4d6 hours. The creature’s
Speed is halved while the creature is Poisoned in
this way.

Truth Serum (150 GP)
Ingested Poison

A creature subjected to Truth Serum must succeed
on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or have the
Poisoned condition for 1 hour. The Poisoned creature can’t knowingly communicate a lie.

Injury Poison

A creature subjected to Wyvern Poison makes a DC
14 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage
on a successful one.

Traps
Traps should be used sparingly, lest they lose their
charm. A hidden pit can be a fun surprise, but too
many traps in an adventure can lead players to become overly cautious, which slows down the game.
The best traps are fleeting distractions that
skilled characters can overcome in a short amount
of time or deadly puzzles that require quick thinking and teamwork to overcome. Traps that are undetectable and inescapable are rarely fun.

Parts of a Trap

The description of a trap includes the following
parts after the trap’s name:

Severity and Levels. A trap is designated as a nuisance or as deadly for characters of certain levels.
A nuisance trap is unlikely to seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a deadly
trap can grievously damage characters of the indicated levels.
Trigger. Traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Examples
of triggers include stepping on a pressure plate,
crossing a trip wire, turning a doorknob, or using
the wrong key in a lock.
Duration. Some traps have durations expressed
in rounds, minutes, or hours. Others specify that
their effects last until the trap is destroyed or
dispelled. If a trap’s duration is instantaneous, its
effect is resolved instantly. If a trap resets after
activating, that fact is noted in this entry. A trap is
otherwise inert after activation.
Use caution when introducing a trap to characters
of a level lower than the trap’s level range. A trap
that is a nuisance at one level range could be deadly
to characters of a lower level range.

Example Traps

Traps are presented in alphabetical order.

Collapsing Roof

Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)

Trigger: A creature crosses a trip wire
Duration: Instantaneous

This trap uses a trip wire to collapse an unstable
section of ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the
ground and stretches between two weak supports
that topple when the trip wire is pulled.
The first creature that crosses the trip wire
causes the supports to topple and the unstable section of ceiling to collapse. Each creature beneath the
unstable section of ceiling must succeed on a DC 13
Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage

199

System Reference Document 5.2.1

on a successful one. Rubble from the collapse turns
the trapped area into Difficult Terrain.
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire
and the unstable section of ceiling on a successful
check. Once detected, the trip wire can be easily cut
or avoided (no ability check required).
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as
shown in the following table.
Levels

Bludgeoning Damage

Save DC

5–10

22 (4d10)

15

11–16

55 (10d10)

17

17–20

99 (18d10)

19

Falling Net

Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger: A creature crosses a trip wire
Duration: Instantaneous

A falling net trap uses a trip wire to release a
weighted, 10-foot-square Net suspended from the
ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and
stretches between two columns or trees.
The first creature that crosses the trip wire
causes the Net to fall on it. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the
Restrained condition until it escapes. The target
succeeds automatically if it’s Huge or larger. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength
(Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature
within its reach from the Net on a successful check.
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire
and the suspended Net on a successful check. Once
detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided
(no ability check required).
Destroy the Net. Reducing the Net to 0 Hit Points
frees any creature trapped in it (see “Adventuring
Gear” for the Net’s statistics).
Set the Trap. A creature that has Thieves’ Tools
and all the trap’s components (including a Net) can
try to set a falling net trap, doing so with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Each
attempt to set this trap takes 10 minutes.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the weight of the Net, which
increases the save DC and the DC of the Strength
(Athletics) check as follows: DC 12 at levels 5–10, DC
14 at levels 11–16, or DC 16 at levels 17–20.

Fire-Casting Statue
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)

Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate

Duration: Instantaneous, and the trap resets at the
start of the next turn

When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure
plate for the first time on a turn or starts its turn
there, a nearby statue exhales a 15-foot Cone of
magical flame. The statue can look like anything,
such as a dragon or a wizard. Each creature in the
Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 11 (2d10) Fire damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Detect and Disarm. A Detect Magic spell reveals
an aura of Evocation magic around the statue. As a
Search action, a creature within 5 feet of the statue
can examine it and make a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting a tiny glyph on the statue on a
successful check. Once the glyph is found, a character can take a Study action to examine it and make a
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, ascertaining that
the glyph means “fire” on a successful check. As an
action, a character can use a sharp tool to deface the
glyph, which disarms the trap.
As a Search action, a creature can examine the
section of floor that forms the pressure plate and
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting
the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging
an Iron Spike or similar object under the pressure
plate prevents the trap from triggering.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the damage and the area of effect, as shown in the following table.
Levels

Fire Damage

Area of Effect

5–10

22 (4d10)

30-foot Cone

11–16

55 (10d10)

60-foot Cone

17–20

99 (18d10)

120-foot Cone

Hidden Pit

Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger: A creature moves onto the pit’s lid
Duration: Instantaneous

200

This 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed
from material identical to the surrounding floor.
When a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open
like a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the
pit. The lid remains open thereafter.
A creature that falls into the pit takes 3 (1d6)
Bludgeoning damage from the fall.
Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature
can examine the section of floor that forms the
pit’s lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, detecting the pit on a successful check.
Once the pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar
object can be wedged between the pit’s lid and the
surrounding floor to prevent the lid from opening,
thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also
be held shut using Arcane Lock or similar magic.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Escape. A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing
gear, or magic such as Spider Climb to scale the pit’s
smooth walls. You can make the pit easier to escape
by adding cracks in the walls big enough to serve as
handholds and footholds.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the pit’s depth and damage, as
shown in the following table.
Levels

Pit Depth

Bludgeoning Damage

5–10

30 feet

Poisoned Darts

Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate
Duration: Instantaneous, and the trap resets at the
start of the next turn if it has activated fewer than
three times

When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure
plate for the first time on a turn, poisoned darts
shoot from tubes embedded in the surrounding
walls. The holes that house these tubes are obscured by dust and cobwebs or skillfully hidden
amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes.
Each creature in the darts’ path must succeed on
a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by 1d3
darts, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage per dart.
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the walls and make a DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check, detecting the holes on a successful check. Plugging all the holes with wax, cloth,
or detritus prevents the darts from firing.
As a Search action, a creature can examine the
section of floor that forms the pressure plate and
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting
the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging
an Iron Spike or a similar object under the pressure
plate prevents the trap from triggering.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing each dart’s Poison damage as
follows: 7 (2d6) at levels 5–10, 14 (4d6) at levels
11–16, or 24 (7d6) at levels 17–20.

Poisoned Needle

Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)

Trigger: A creature opens the trap’s lock improperly
or fails to disarm the trap
Duration: Instantaneous

A poisoned needle is hidden in a lock. When a creature opens the lock with any object other than the
proper key, the needle springs out and stabs the
creature. The creature makes a DC 11 Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
5 (1d10) Poison damage and has the Poisoned

condition for 1 hour. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
Avoid. The trap doesn’t trigger if the lock is
opened using a Knock spell or similar magic.
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the trapped lock and make a DC 15
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the needle on
a successful check. Once the trap is detected, a character can take an action to try to disarm the trap,
doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight
of Hand) check. On a failed check, the creature triggers the trap.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as
shown in the following table.
Levels

Poison Damage

Save DC

5–10

11 (2d10)

13

11–16

22 (4d10)

15

17–20

55 (10d10)

Rolling Stone

Deadly Trap (Levels 11–16) or Nuisance Trap (Levels
17–20)
Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate
Duration: Until the stone stops rolling

When a creature moves onto a hidden pressure
plate, a 5-foot-radius orb of solid stone is released
from a secret compartment and begins to roll. The
stone and all creatures nearby roll Initiative; the
stone gets a +8 bonus on its Initiative roll.
On its turn, the stone moves 60 feet in one direction, changing course if redirected by an obstacle.
The stone can move through creatures’ spaces,
and creatures can move through the stone’s space,
treating it as Difficult Terrain. Whenever the stone
enters a creature’s space for the first time on a turn
or a creature enters the stone’s space while the
stone is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone condition.
The stone stops when it hits a wall or similar
barrier. It can’t go around corners, but creative
dungeon builders incorporate curving turns into
nearby passages that allow the stone to keep
moving.
Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature
can examine the section of floor that forms the
pressure plate and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, deducing the pressure plate’s
function on a successful check. Wedging an Iron
Spike or a similar object under the pressure plate
prevents the trap from triggering.

201

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Destroy the Stone. The stone is a Large object
that has AC 17, HP 100, a Damage Threshold of 10,
and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.
Slow the Stone. As an action, a creature can try to
slow down the stone with a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check is successful, the distance the
stone moves on its turn is reduced by 15 feet. If that
distance drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer
a threat.

Spiked Pit

Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)

Trigger: A creature moves onto the pit’s lid
Duration: Instantaneous

A 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed from
material identical to the surrounding floor. When
a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open like
a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the pit,
which has sharpened wooden or metal spikes at the
bottom. The lid remains open thereafter.
A creature that falls into the pit lands at the
bottom and takes 3 (1d6) Bludgeoning damage
from the fall plus 9 (2d8) Piercing damage from
the spikes.
Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature
can examine the section of floor that forms the pit’s
lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
check, detecting the pit on a successful check. Once
the hidden pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar
object can be wedged between the pit’s lid and the
surrounding floor to prevent the lid from opening,
thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also
be held shut using an Arcane Lock spell or similar
magic.
Escape. A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing
gear, or magic such as a Spider Climb spell to scale
the pit’s smooth walls. You can make the pit easier
to escape by adding cracks in the walls big enough
to serve as handholds and footholds.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the pit’s depth and damage, as
shown in the following table.
Levels

Pit Depth

Damage

5–10

30 feet

10 (3d6) Bludgeoning plus 13
(3d8) Piercing

11–16

60 feet

21 (6d6) Bludgeoning plus 36
(8d8) Piercing

17–20

120 feet

42 (12d6) Bludgeoning plus 57
(13d8) Piercing

Combat Encounters
The following features can make a combat encounter more interesting or challenging:

Changes in Elevation. Terrain features that provide a change of elevation (such as stacks of empty
crates, ledges, and balconies) reward clever positioning and encourage characters to jump, climb,
fly, or teleport.
Defensive Positions. Enemies in hard-to-reach
locations or defensive positions force characters
who normally attack at range to move around.
Mixed Monster Groups. When different types
of monsters work together, they can combine
their abilities—just like characters with different classes and origins. A diverse force is more
powerful.
Reasons to Move. Use features that encourage
characters and their enemies to move around,
such as chandeliers, kegs of gunpowder or oil, and
rolling stone traps.

13,200

22,000

Low Difficulty. An encounter of low difficulty is
likely to have one or two scary moments for the
players, but their characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them
might need to use healing resources, however.
As a rough guideline, a single monster generally
presents a low-difficulty challenge for a party of
four characters whose level equals the monster’s
Challenge Rating.
Moderate Difficulty. Absent healing and other resources, an encounter of moderate difficulty could
go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters
might get taken out of the fight, and there’s a slim
chance that one or more characters might die.
High Difficulty. A high-difficulty encounter could
be lethal for one or more characters. To survive
it, the characters will need smart tactics, quick
thinking, and maybe even a little luck.

Step 2: Determine Your XP Budget

Using the XP Budget per Character table, cross-reference the party’s level with the desired encounter
difficulty. Multiply the number in the table by the
number of characters in the party to get your XP
budget for the encounter.

202

XP Budget per Character

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Step 3: Spend Your Budget
Every creature has an XP value in its stat block.
When you add a creature to your combat encounter,
deduct its XP from your XP budget to determine
how many XP you have left to spend. Spend as much
of your XP budget as you can without going over. It’s
OK if you have a few unspent XP left over. Examples
are given below:

Example 1. A low-difficulty encounter for four level
1 characters has an XP budget of 50 × 4, for a total
of 200 XP. With that, you could build any of the following encounters:
• 1 Bugbear Warrior (200 XP)
• 2 Giant Wasps (100 XP each), for 200 XP total
• 6 Giant Rats (25 XP each), for 150 XP total

Example 2. A moderate-difficulty encounter for
five level 3 characters has an XP budget of 225 × 5,
for a total of 1,125 XP. With that, you could build
either of these encounters:

• 2 Druids (450 XP each) and 9 Stirges (25 XP
each), for 1,125 XP total
• 1 Wight (700 XP), 1 Warhorse Skeleton (100 XP),
and 6 Skeletons (50 XP each), for 1,100 XP total

Example 3. A high-difficulty encounter for six level
15 characters has an XP budget of 7,800 × 6, for a
total of 46,800 XP. With that, you could build this
encounter:

CR 0 Creatures

Troubleshooting

The best combat encounters often pair one kind of
creature with another, such as fire giants paired
with hell hounds. Be mindful of the number of stat
blocks you need to run the encounter. Referencing
more than two or three stat blocks for a single encounter can be daunting, particularly if the creatures are complex.

• 2 Adult Red Dragons (18,000 XP each) and 2 Fire
Giants (5,000 XP each), for 46,000 XP total
When creating and running combat encounters,
keep the following in mind.

Many Creatures

The more creatures in an encounter, the higher
the risk that a lucky streak on their part could deal
more damage to the characters than you expect. If
your encounter includes more than two creatures
per character, include fragile creatures that can be
defeated quickly. This guideline is especially important for characters of level 1 or 2.

Adjustments

A player’s absence might warrant removing creatures from an encounter to keep it at the intended
difficulty. Also, die rolls and other factors can result
in an encounter being easier or harder than intended. You can adjust an encounter on the fly, such
as by having creatures flee (making the encounter
easier) or adding reinforcements (making the encounter harder).

203

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Creatures that have a CR of 0, particularly ones that
are worth 0 XP, should be used sparingly. If you
want to include many CR 0 critters in an encounter,
use swarms instead.

Number of Stat Blocks

Powerful Creatures

If your combat encounter includes a creature whose
CR is higher than the party’s level, be aware that
such a creature might deal enough damage with a
single action to take out one or more characters. For
example, an Ogre (CR 2) can kill a level 1 Wizard
with a single blow.

Unusual Features

If a monster has a feature that lower-level characters can’t easily overcome, consider not adding that
monster to an encounter for characters whose level
is lower than the monster’s Challenge Rating.

Magic Items
Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled
monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such
items grant capabilities a character could rarely
have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s
capabilities in wondrous ways.

Magic Item Categories

Every magic item belongs to a category. The Magic
Item Categories table lists the nine categories and
provides examples. Rules for the categories appear
after the table.

Magic Item Categories

When a character mixes two potions together, roll
on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are
combined, roll again for each subsequent potion,
combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become
evident.

Potion Miscibility
1d100

01

Both potions lose their effects, and the
mixture creates a magical explosion in a
5-foot-radius Sphere centered on itself.
Each creature in that area takes 4d10 Force
damage.

02–08 Both potions lose their effects, and the mixture becomes an ingested poison of your
choice (see “Poison” in “Gameplay Toolbox”).

Category

Examples

Armor

+1 Leather Armor, +1 Shield

Potions

Potion of Healing

Rings

Ring of Invisibility

Rods

Immovable Rod

Scrolls

Spell Scroll

Staffs

Staff of Striking

26–35 Both potions work, but with their numerical
effects and durations halved. If a potion has
no numerical effect and no duration, it instead
loses its effect.

Wands

Wand of Fireballs

36–90 Both potions work normally.

Weapons

+1 Ammunition, +1 Longsword

91–99

Wondrous Items

Bag of Holding, Boots of Elvenkind

Both potions work, but the numerical effects
and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way,
they work normally.

An item in the Armor category is typically a magical
version of armor from “Equipment.” Unless an armor’s description notes otherwise, the armor must
be worn for its magic to function.
Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If
no type is specified, choose the type or determine it
randomly.

00

Only one potion works, but its effects are
permanent. Choose the simplest effect to
make permanent or the one that seems the
most fun. For example, a Potion of Healing
might increase the drinker’s Hit Point maximum by 2d4 + 2, or a Potion of Invisibility might
give the drinker the Invisible condition indefinitely. At your discretion, a Dispel Magic spell
or similar magic might end this lasting effect.

An item in the Potion category might be a magical
brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be
applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion
consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.
Using a Potion. Potions are consumable items.
Drinking a potion or administering it to another
creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil
might take longer as specified in its description.
Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it
is used up.
Mixing Potions. A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another or pour
several potions into a single container. The strange
ingredients used in creating potions can result in
unpredictable interactions.

Rings

09–15

Both potions lose their effects.

16–25

One potion loses its effect.

204

Result

System Reference Document 5.2.1

For its magic to function, an item in the Ring category must be worn on a finger or a similar digit unless its description notes otherwise.

Rods

An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually
made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs
2 to 5 pounds.
Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can
be used as an Arcane Focus.

Scrolls
An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or
parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods
and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade,
leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is
the Spell Scroll, a spell stored in written form.
Using a Scroll. Scrolls are consumable items. Unleashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to
read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked,
the scroll can’t be used again. Its words fade, or it
crumbles into dust.
Any creature that can understand a written language can read a scroll and attempt to activate it
unless its description notes otherwise.

Staffs

Items in the Staff category vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout
and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some
are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and
7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane.
Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can
be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane
Focus.

Wands

An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15
inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It
is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other
material.
Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand
can be used as an Arcane Focus.

Weapons

A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a
weapon from “Equipment.” Some magic weapons
specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no
weapon type is specified, you may choose the type
or determine it randomly.
Ammunition. If a magic weapon has the Ammunition property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares
whether a weapon is magical or not.

Wondrous Items

Wondrous Items include wearable items such
as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and
circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical
instruments, and more also fall into this category.

205

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Magic Item Rules
Rules for identifying, attuning to, and using magic
items appear in “Equipment.” Additional rules are
presented below.
Attunement Prerequisites. If a magic item has
a class prerequisite, a creature must be a member of
that class to attune to the item. If a creature must be
a spellcaster to attune to an item, the creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or
features, not by using a magic item or the like.
Items Made for Specific Creatures. Magic
items that are meant to be worn tend to magically
adjust themselves to the wearer. However, you can
decide that a magic item doesn’t adjust its size to fit
any wearer. For example, a particular armorer might
make items usable only by folk who are sized and
shaped like dwarves.
Unusual Anatomy. Use your discretion to decide
whether a creature can wear an item not made for
its anatomy. A ring placed on a tentacle might work,
but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t
wear magic boots.
Paired Items. You can allow exceptions to the
rule that paired items must both be worn. For example, a character with only one arm might be able
to use a single Glove of Missile Snaring so long as the
matching glove is on their person.

Magic Item Rarity
Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a
rough measure of an item’s power relative to other
magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic
Item Rarities and Values table.
Common magic items, such as a Potion of Healing,
are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the Dragon
Orb, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire.

Magic Item Values by Rarity

Common magic items can often be bought in a
town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are
usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items
might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as a
city on another plane of existence. If you allow characters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign,
rarity can help you set prices for those items. Gold
Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities
and Values table, though a seller might ask for a service rather than coin as payment.
If a magic item incorporates an item that has a
purchase cost in “Equipment” (such as a weapon or
a suit of armor), add that item’s cost to the magic
item’s value. For example, +1 Armor (Plate Armor)

has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare
magic item’s value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate
Armor (1,500 GP).

The value of a Spell Scroll is double what it costs to scribe the scroll

Activating a Magic Item
It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic
item. The item’s user might also need to do something special. The description of each item category
or individual item details how an item is activated.
Certain items use the following rules for their
activation.

Command Word

A command word is a word or short phrase that
must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spoken command words must be audible and fail to
work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in
the area of the Silence spell.

Consumable Items

Some items are consumed—used up, in other
words—when they are activated. A Potion of Healing
must be swallowed, for example, while the writing
vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a
consumable item loses its magic.

Spells Cast from Items

Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from
the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible
spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components unless
the item’s description notes otherwise. The spell
uses its normal casting time, range, and duration,
and the user of the item must concentrate if the
spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as
Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the
spell’s effects with its usual duration. Certain items
make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.
A magic item may require the user to use their
own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from
the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting
ability, the user chooses which one to use with the
item. If the user doesn’t have a spellcasting ability,

206

System Reference Document 5.2.1

their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item,
and the user’s Proficiency Bonus applies.

Charges

Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number
of charges an item has remaining is revealed when
the Identify spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to
an item knows how many charges the item has and
how many it regains.

“The Next Dawn”

Magic items often have charges or properties that
recharge at the next dawn or some other specified
time. If such an item is on a world or plane of existence where the specified event doesn’t occur, the
GM determines when the item recharges.

Cursed Items

A magic item’s description specifies whether it
bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, including the Identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse.
Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a
Remove Curse spell.

Magic Item Resilience

A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical
item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Potions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage.
An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special
way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learning how to destroy an Artifact usually requires
research or the completion of a quest.

Crafting Magic Items

“Equipment” contains rules on brewing Potions of
Healing and scribing Spell Scrolls. To create other
magic items, follow the rules below. In these rules,
“you” refers to the character crafting the magic
item.

Arcana Proficiency

To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must
have proficiency in the Arcana skill.

Tools

The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool is required to make a magic item of each category. You
must use the required tool to make an item and
have proficiency with that tool. Any assistants must
also have proficiency with it. For more information
on the tools, see “Equipment.”

Spells
If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells
from it, you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.

Time and Cost

Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and
money based on the item’s rarity as shown in the
Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table.
Work per Day. For each day of crafting, you must
work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days,
those days needn’t be consecutive.
Assistants. Characters can combine their efforts
to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed
to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can
assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.
Raw Materials. The cost in the table represents
the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The
GM determines whether appropriate raw materials
are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance
that the materials are available, and in any other
settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials
aren’t available, you must wait at least 7 days before
checking on the availability again.
If a magic item incorporates an item that has a
purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor),
you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item
using the rules in “Equipment.” For example, to
make +1 Armor (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500
GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the armor.

Sentient Magic Items
Some magic items have sentience and personality.
Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the
spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to
the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be
a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in
the side.
Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds
of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items
such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.
The GM controls sentient magic items and their
activated properties. A bearer who maintains a
good relationship with the item can access those
properties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict
can ensue (see “Conflict” below).

Sentient Magic Item Traits

When you make a sentient magic item, you create
the item’s persona much as you would create an
NPC, with these exceptions.

Abilities

A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma scores. Choose the item’s abilities, or determine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6 for each
one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.

Alignment

A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator
or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise,
pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient Item’s
Alignment table.

Communication

A sentient item communicates by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or
speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the Sentient Item’s Communication
table.

Senses

A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to
a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on
the Sentient Item’s Senses table.

Special Purpose
You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues,
perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the
wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special
purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating
from this course might cause conflict between the
wielder and the item (see “Conflict” below). You can
pick a special purpose or roll on the Sentient Item’s
Special Purpose table.

and wants to understand why it was created.

4

Destiny Seeker. The item believes it and its
bearer have key roles to play in future events.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

1d10

Special Purpose

5

Destroyer. The item craves destruction and
goads its user to fight arbitrarily.

6

Glory Seeker. The item seeks renown as the
greatest magic item in the world by winning
fame or notoriety for its user.

7

Lore Seeker. The item craves knowledge or is
determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret,
or unravel a cryptic prophecy.

8

Protector. The item seeks to defend a particular kind of creature, such as elves or
werewolves.

9

Soulmate Seeker. The item seeks another
sentient magic item, perhaps one that is similar
to itself.

10

Templar. The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity.

Conflict
When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner
opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict
can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item’s
bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus
the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the
item makes one or more of the following demands:

Chase My Dreams. The item demands that its
bearer pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of
all other goals.
Get Rid of It. The item demands that its bearer dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.
It’s Time for a Change. The item demands to be
given to someone else.
Keep Me Close. The item insists on being carried or
worn at all times.
If its bearer refuses to comply with the item’s demands, the item can do any of the following:

• Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it.
• Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
• Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon
the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC
12 plus the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed
save, the bearer has the Charmed condition for
1d12 hours. While Charmed in this way, the
bearer must try to follow the item’s commands.
If the bearer takes damage, it repeats the save,
ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the
attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item
can’t use this power again until the next dawn.

Magic Items A–Z

Magic items are presented in alphabetical order.
If a magic item description capitalizes a creature’s

Uncommon

This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine,
one of the hardest substances in existence. While

Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3

Weapon (Any Ammunition), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2),
or Very Rare (+3)
You have a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition.

ammunition are equivalent in value to a potion of
the same rarity.

Ammunition of Slaying

Weapon (Any Ammunition), Very Rare

This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures
of a particular type, which the GM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If
a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage
on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a
successful one.
After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the
ammunition becomes nonmagical.

Apparatus of the Crab
Wondrous Item, Legendary

This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel
weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden
catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20
Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the
catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl
inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end,
each in a neutral position, able to move up or down.
When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.
The Apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with
the following statistics: AC 20; HP 200; Speed 30
ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs aren’t extended); Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.
To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires
one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the
compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures
inside.
The apparatus floats on water. It can also go
underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the
vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute
from pressure.
A creature in the compartment can take a Utilize
action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s
levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back
to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right,
functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab
Levers table.

Armor of Vulnerability

Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Rare (Requires
Attunement)
While wearing this armor, you have Resistance to
one of the following damage types: Bludgeoning,
Piercing, or Slashing. The GM chooses the type or
determines it randomly.
Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed
only when the Identify spell is cast on the armor or
you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you
until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or
similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the
curse. While cursed, you have Vulnerability to two
of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants Resistance).

1d100

roll, the treant is Chaotic Evil. On an even
roll, the treant is Chaotic Good.

you are. The statue becomes inanimate after
24 hours.

smoke.

61–70

A hungry Bulette burrows up and attacks.

71–80

A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8
of which act as randomly determined potions. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked

81–90

A nest of 1d4 + 3 rainbow-colored eggs
springs up. Any creature that eats an egg
makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw.

increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores.
On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6
Force damage from an internal explosion.

91–95

Arrow-Catching Shield

Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)

You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class against ranged
attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus
is in addition to the Shield’s normal bonus to AC.
Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll
against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a
Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.

Bag of Beans

Wondrous Item, Rare

This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when
found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of
how many beans it contains and becomes a nonmagical item when it no longer contains any beans.
If you dump one or more beans out of the bag,
they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on
them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the explosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including
you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking
5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one.
If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt
or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it
produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground
where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect
from the following table or determine it randomly.
1d100

01

02–10

211

Effect

5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a
toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the

saving throw or take 5d6 Poison damage and
have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On
an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 Temporary
Hit Points for 1 hour.
A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer,
mayonnaise, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s
choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d4 minutes.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Bag of Devouring

Bag of Tricks

This bag resembles a Bag of Holding but is a feeding
orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature.
Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.
The extradimensional creature attached to the
bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag.
Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the
bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when
someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent
chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A
creature inside the bag can take an action to try to
escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength
(Athletics) check. Another creature can take an action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics)
check, provided the puller isn’t pulled inside the bag
first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag
is devoured, its body destroyed.
Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which
can hold a cubic foot of such material. However,
once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside
it and spits them out into another plane of existence.
The GM determines the time and plane.
If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and
anything contained within it is transported to a
random location on the Astral Plane.

This bag made from gray, rust, or tan cloth appears
empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals
the presence of a small, fuzzy object.
You can take a Magic action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When
the object lands, it transforms into a creature you
determine by rolling on the table that corresponds
to the bag’s color. See “Monsters” for the creature’s
stat block. The creature vanishes at the next dawn
or when it is reduced to 0 Hit Points.
The creature is Friendly to you and your allies,
and it acts immediately after you on your Initiative
count. You can take a Bonus Action to command
how the creature moves and what action it takes on
its next turn, such as attacking an enemy. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion
appropriate to its nature.
Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from
the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next
dawn.

This bag has an interior space considerably larger
than its outside dimensions—roughly 2 feet square
and 4 feet deep on the inside. The bag can hold up
to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic
feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its
contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires
a Utilize action.
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral
Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents
spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right
before it can be used again. The bag holds enough
air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.
Placing a Bag of Holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable
Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items
and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the
other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere
centered on the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then
closes. The gate is one-way and can’t be reopened.

Bead of Force

Wondrous Item, Rare
This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in
diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4
Beads of Force are found together.
You can take a Magic action to throw the bead up
to 60 feet. The bead explodes in a 10-foot-radius
Sphere on impact and is destroyed. Each creature

in the Sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw or take 5d4 Force damage. A sphere
of transparent force then encloses the area for 1
minute. Any creature that failed the save and is
completely within the area is trapped inside this
sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are
partially within the area are pushed away from the
center of the sphere until they are no longer inside
it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s
wall. No attack or other effect can pass through.
An enclosed creature can take a Utilize action to
push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere
up to half the creature’s Speed. The sphere can be
picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1
pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

Bead of Nourishment
Wondrous Item, Common

This flavorless, gelatinous bead dissolves on your
tongue and provides as much nourishment as 1 day
of Rations.

Berserker Axe

Weapon (Battleaxe, Greataxe, or Halberd), Rare
(Requires Attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. In addition, while
you are attuned to this weapon, your Hit Point
maximum increases by 1 for each level you have
attained.
Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you
remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the
weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. You
also have Disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one.
Whenever another creature damages you while
the weapon is in your possession, you must succeed
on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. This
berserk state ends when you start your turn and
there are no creatures within 60 feet of you that you
can see or hear.
While berserk, you regard the creature nearest
to you that you can see or hear as your enemy. If
there are multiple possible creatures, choose one at
random. On each of your turns, you must move as
close to the creature as possible and take the Attack
action, targeting the creature. If you’re unable to
get close enough to the creature to attack it with
the weapon, your turn ends after you’ve used up all
your available movement. If the creature dies or can
no longer be seen or heard by you, the next nearest
creature that you can see or hear becomes your
new target.

Boots of Elvenkind

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

sound, regardless of the surface you are moving
across. You also have Advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks.

on yourself.

Boots of Speed

Bracers of Defense

While you wear these boots, you can take a Bonus
Action to click the boots’ heels together. If you do,
the boots double your Speed, and any creature that
makes an Opportunity Attack against you has Disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels
together again, you end the effect.
When you’ve used the boots’ property for a total
of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you
until you finish a Long Rest.

While wearing these bracers, you gain a +2 bonus to
Armor Class if you are wearing no armor and using
no Shield.

Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)

Boots of Striding and Springing

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)

While you wear these boots, your Speed becomes
30 feet unless your Speed is higher, and your Speed
isn’t reduced by you carrying weight in excess of
your carrying capacity or wearing Heavy Armor.
Once on each of your turns, you can jump up to 30
feet by spending only 10 feet of movement.

Boots of the Winterlands

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)

Cold Resistance. You have Resistance to Cold
damage and can tolerate temperatures of 0 degrees
Fahrenheit or lower without any additional
protection.

Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals
Wondrous Item, Rare

While this bowl is filled with water and you are
within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action to
summon a Water Elemental. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the bowl
as possible, understands your languages, obeys
your commands, and takes its turn immediately
after you on your Initiative count. The elemental
disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you
dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The bowl can’t be used

immediately after you on your Initiative count. The
elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or
when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The brazier

Brooch of Shielding

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)

Force damage, and you have Immunity to damage

Broom of Flying

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)

broom until you stand astride it and take a Magic
action to make it hover beneath you, at which time
it can be ridden in the air. It has a Fly Speed of 50
feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its Fly Speed
becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds.
The broom stops hovering when you land or when
you’re no longer riding it.
As a Magic action, you can send the broom to
travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if
you name the location and are familiar with it. The
broom comes back to you when you take a Magic
action and use a command word if the broom is still
within 1 mile of you.

Candle of Invocation

Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

This candle’s magic is activated when the candle
is lit, which requires a Magic action. After burning
for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff
it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time
it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total
burn time.
While lit, the candle sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot
radius. While you are within that light, you have
Advantage on D20 Tests. In addition, a Cleric or
Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have
prepared without expending spell slots.
Alternatively, when you light the candle for the
first time, you can cast Gate with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell

links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the GM

Dagger of Venom

Weapon (Dagger), Rare

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
You can take a Bonus Action to magically coat the
blade with poison. The poison remains for 1 minute
or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature.
That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or take 2d10 Poison damage and have
the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. The weapon
can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

Dancing Sword

Weapon (Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar, or
Shortsword), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
You can take a Bonus Action to toss this magic
weapon into the air. When you do so, the weapon
begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one
creature of your choice within 5 feet of itself. The
weapon uses your attack roll and adds your ability
modifier to damage rolls.
While the weapon hovers, you can take a Bonus
Action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot
within 30 feet of you. As part of the same Bonus Action, you can cause the weapon to attack one creature within 5 feet of the weapon.
After the hovering weapon attacks for the fourth
time, it flies back to you and tries to return to your
hand. If you have no hand free, the weapon falls to
the ground in your space. If the weapon has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as
it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to
hover if you grasp it or are more than 30 feet away
from it.

Decanter of Endless Water
Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it
contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.
You can take a Magic action to remove the stopper
and issue one of three command words, whereupon
an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice)
pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out
at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following command words:
Splash. The decanter produces 1 gallon of water.
Fountain. The decanter produces 5 gallons of water.
Geyser. The decanter produces 30 gallons of water
that gushes forth in a Line 30 feet long and 1 foot
wide. If you’re holding the decanter, you can aim
the geyser in one direction (no action required).
One creature of your choice in the Line must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take
1d4 Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone condition. Instead of a creature, you can target one
object in the Line that isn’t being worn or carried
and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The
object is knocked over by the geyser.

Deck of Illusions

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34
cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with
a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards.
The magic of the deck functions only if its cards
are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action
to draw a card at random from the deck and throw

217

System Reference Document 5.2.1

it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself.
An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on
the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown
card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a
real creature of its kind, except that it can do no
harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory
creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action
to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.
Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass
through it. A creature that takes a Study action to
visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as
an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card
is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel
Magic spell or a similar effect). When the illusion
ends, the image on its card disappears, and that
card can’t be used again.

Defender

Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Legendary (Requires
Attunement)
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
The first time you attack with the weapon on each
of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the
weapon’s bonus to your Armor Class. For example,
you could reduce the bonus to your attack rolls and
damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to Armor
Class. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until
the start of your next turn, although you must hold
the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it.

Demon Armor

Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Very Rare
(Requires Attunement)

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to
Armor Class, and you know Abyssal. In addition,
the armor’s clawed gauntlets allow your Unarmed
Strikes to deal 1d8 Slashing damage instead of the
usual Bludgeoning damage, and you gain a +1 bonus
to the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed
Strikes.
Curse. Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t
doff it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse
spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor,
you have Disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and
special abilities.

Dimensional Shackles
Wondrous Item, Rare

218

You can take a Utilize action to place these shackles
on a creature that has the Incapacitated condition.
The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to
Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound
by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel
to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent
the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.
You and any creature you designate when you
use the shackles can take a Utilize action to remove
them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can

System Reference Document 5.2.1

make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature breaks free and destroys
the shackles.

Dragon Orb

Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in
diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in
diameter, and mist swirls inside it.
While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic
action to peer into the orb’s depths. You must then
make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes
the Charmed condition on you for as long as you
remain attuned to it.
While you are Charmed by the orb, you can’t
voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb
casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging
you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The
dragon essence within the orb might want many
things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat,
or something else the GM decides.
Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3
expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the
orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following
table from it. The table indicates how many charges
you must expend to cast the spell.

Call Dragons. While you control the orb, you
can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a
telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40
miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled
to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most
direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to
the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling
them against their will. Once you have used this
property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.
Destroying an Orb. A Dragon Orb has AC 20 and is
destroyed if it takes damage from a +3 Weapon or a
Disintegrate spell. Nothing else can harm it.

Dragon Scale Mail

Armor (Scale Mail), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

Dragon Scale Mail is made of the scales of one kind
of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off

scales and gift them. Other times, hunters carefully
preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case,
Dragon Scale Mail is highly valued.
While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to
Armor Class, you have Advantage on saving throws
against the breath weapons of Dragons, and you
have Resistance to one damage type determined by
the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the
accompanying table).
Additionally, you can focus your senses as a Magic
action to discern the distance and direction to the
closest dragon within 30 miles of yourself that is
of the same type as the armor. This action can’t be
used again until the next dawn.

Dust of Sneezing and Choking
Wondrous Item, Uncommon

Found in a small container, this powder resembles
Dust of Disappearance, and Identify reveals it to be
such. There is enough of it for one use.
As a Utilize action, you can throw the dust into the
air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot
Emanation originating from you to make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals,
Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save
automatically.
On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing uncontrollably; it has the Incapacitated condition and
is suffocating. The creature repeats the save at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success. The effect also ends on any creature targeted by a Lesser Restoration spell.

Dwarven Plate

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
The weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage of the
weapon’s type if the target is a Dragon.

Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Very Rare

This powder resembles fine sand. There is enough
of it for one use. When you take a Utilize action to
throw the dust into the air, you and each creature
and object within a 10-foot Emanation originating
from you have the Invisible condition for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and
the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect.
Immediately after an affected creature makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell, the Invisible
condition ends for that creature.

Dwarven Thrower

Dust of Disappearance
Wondrous Item, Uncommon

Dust of Dryness

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust.
As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the
dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot Cube of
water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats
or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The
pellet’s weight is negligible. A creature can take
a Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard
surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the
water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.
As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the
dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that

219

is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Elemental). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the
dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as
much damage on a successful one.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to
Armor Class. In addition, if an effect moves you
against your will along the ground, you can take a
Reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by
up to 10 feet.

Weapon (Warhammer), Very Rare (Requires
Attunement by a Dwarf or a Creature Attuned to a Belt
of Dwarvenkind)
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. It has the Thrown
property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long
range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack
using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is
a Giant. Immediately after hitting or missing, the
weapon flies back to your hand.

Efficient Quiver

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects
to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver
to hold numerous items while never weighing more
than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold
up to 60 Arrows, Bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to 18 Javelins or similar
objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long
objects, such as bows, Quarterstaffs, or Spears.
You can draw any item the quiver contains as if
doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.

Efreeti Bottle

Elven Chain

When you take a Magic action to remove the stopper
of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick smoke
flows out of it. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an Efreeti
appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls on
the following table to determine what happens.

You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class while you wear
this armor. You are considered trained with this armor even if you lack training with Medium or Heavy
armor.

Wondrous Item, Very Rare

1d10

Effect

The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5
rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle
loses its magic.

2–9

The efreeti understands your languages and
obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which
it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper
contains it. The stopper can’t be removed for
24 hours. The next two times the bottle is
opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is
opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and
disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.

10

The efreeti understands your languages and can
cast Wish once for you. It disappears when it
grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle
loses its magic.

Elemental Gem

Wondrous Item, Uncommon
This gem contains a mote of elemental energy.
When you take a Utilize action to break the gem,
an elemental is summoned (see “Monsters” for its
stat block), and the gem ceases to be magical. The
elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close
to the broken gem as possible, understands your
languages, obeys your commands, and takes its
turn immediately after you on your Initiative count.
The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies,
or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The type
of gem determines the elemental, as shown in the
following table.
Gem

Elixir of Health
Potion, Rare

When you drink this potion, you are cured of all

220

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Armor (Chain Mail or Chain Shirt), Rare

Energy Bow

Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires
Attunement)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon, which has no string.
Each time you pull your arm back in a firing motion,
a magical arrow made of golden energy appears
nocked and ready to fire. An arrow produced by
this weapon deals Force damage instead of Piercing damage on a hit, and it disappears after it hits
or misses its target. Until it disappears, the arrow
emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light
for an additional 20 feet.
This weapon has the following additional
properties.
Arrow of Restraint. Whenever you use this
weapon to make a ranged attack against a creature,
you can try to restrain the target instead of dealing damage to it. If the arrow hits, the target must
succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have
the Restrained condition for 1 minute. As an action,
a creature Restrained by an arrow can make a DC
20 Strength (Athletics) check to try to break the
restraint, ending the effect on itself on a successful
check.
Arrow of Transport. As a Magic action, you can
fire one energy arrow from this weapon at a target
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target
can be either a willing Medium or smaller creature
or an object that isn’t being worn or carried, provided the object is small enough to fit inside a 5-foot
Cube. The arrow teleports the target to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you.
Energy Ladder. As a Magic action, you can loose a
flurry of energy arrows from this weapon at a wall
up to 60 feet away from yourself. The arrows become glowing rungs that stick out of the wall, forming a magical ladder up to 60 feet long on the wall.
This ladder lasts for 1 minute before disappearing.

Eversmoking Bottle

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

As a Magic action, you can open or close this bottle.
Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow
out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot Emanation
originating from the bottle. The area within the
smoke is Heavily Obscured.
Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of
the Emanation increases by 10 feet until it reaches
its maximum size of 120 feet.

Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become
fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes.
A strong wind (such as that created by the Gust of
Wind spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.

Eyes of Charming

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have
3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend
1 or more charges to cast Charm Person (save DC
13). For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the
spell. You increase the spell’s level by one for each
additional charge you expend. The lenses regain all
expended charges daily at dawn.

Eyes of Minute Seeing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, your vision improves significantly out to a
range of 1 foot, granting you Darkvision within that
range and Advantage on Intelligence (Investigation)
checks made to examine something within that
range.

Eyes of the Eagle

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of
clear visibility, you can make out details of even
extremely distant creatures and objects as small as
2 feet across.

Feather Token

Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies

This object looks like a feather. Different types of
feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use
effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens
table. The type of token determines its rarity.
Anchor (Uncommon). You can take a Magic action
to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next
24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means.
Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.
Bird (Rare). You can take a Magic action to toss
the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears
and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place.
The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can’t attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry
up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum
speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144
miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of
flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird
disappears after flying its maximum distance for a
day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the
bird as a Magic action.

221

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Fan (Uncommon). If you are on a boat or ship,
you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to
10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant
flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one
ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8
hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.
Swan Boat (Rare). You can take a Magic action to
touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet
in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-footlong, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its
place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across
water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take
a Magic action while on the boat to command it to
move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains
for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss
the boat as a Magic action.
Tree (Uncommon). You must be outdoors to use
this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it
to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token
disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree
springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and
has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the
top spread out in a 20-foot radius.
Whip (Rare). You can take a Magic action to
throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself.
The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its
place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a
melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet
of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the
target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.
As a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly
up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature
within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after
1 hour, when you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or
when you die or have the Incapacitated condition.

Figurine of Wondrous Power
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies

A Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small
enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground
within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a
living creature specified in the figurine’s description below. If the space where the creature would
appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or

if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.
The creature is Friendly to you and your allies.
It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on
your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the
creature defends itself but takes no other actions.
The creature exists for a duration specific to each
figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature
reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine
early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if
you take a Magic action while touching the creature
to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t
be used again until a certain amount of time has
passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.
Bronze Griffon (Rare). This bronze statuette is of
a griffon rampant. It can become a Griffon for up to
6 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again
until 5 days have passed.

222

Goat of Terror. This figurine can become a Giant
Goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but
you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use
them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 Lance,
and the other becomes a +2 Longsword. Removing
a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons
disappear and the horns return when the goat
reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat,
any Hostile creature that starts its turn within

System Reference Document 5.2.1

a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until
you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat
reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature
repeats the save at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it
succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to
this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine
has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days
have passed.
Goat of Traveling. This figurine can become a
Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding
Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge.
While it has charges, you can use it as often as you
wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a
figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have
passed, when it regains all expended charges.
Goat of Travail. This figurine can become a Giant
Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it
can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.

Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette
resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an
Elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used,
it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.
Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian horse can become a Nightmare for up to 24
hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself.
Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5
days have passed.
The figurine has a 10 percent chance each time
you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the
nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you
and the nightmare are instantly transported to a
random location on the plane of Hades, where the
nightmare reverts to figurine form.
Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can
become a Mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has
an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also

passed.

of an owl can become a Giant Owl for up to 8 hours.

of a raven can become a Raven for up to 12 hours.

flames to engulf the damage-dealing part of the
weapon. These flames shed Bright Light in a 40foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet.

Fire damage on a hit. The flames last until you take
a Bonus Action to issue the command again or until
you drop, stow, or sheathe the weapon.

Folding Boat

Wondrous Item, Rare

This object appears as a wooden box that measures
12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep.
It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to
store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring a Magic action to use:

First Command Word. The box unfolds into a
Rowboat.
Second Command Word. The box unfolds into a
Keelboat.
Third Command Word. The Folding Boat folds back
into a box if no creatures are aboard. Any objects
in the vessel that can’t fit inside the box remain
outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes
that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that
was stored in the box remains in the boat.
Statistics for the Rowboat and Keelboat appear
in “Equipment.” If either vessel is reduced to 0 Hit
Points, the Folding Boat is destroyed.

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding
it, you can take a Magic action and use one of three
command words to cause one of the following
effects:

First Command Word. The gem sheds Bright Light
in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional
30 feet. This effect doesn’t expend a charge. It
lasts until you take a Bonus Action to repeat the
command word or until you use another function
of the gem.
Second Command Word. You expend 1 charge and
cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at
one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition
for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
on a success.
Third Command Word. You expend 5 charges and
cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with
the second command word.

accessories—but the armor retains its normal bulk
and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you
use this property again or doff the armor.

Gloves of Missile Snaring

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)

If you’re hit by an attack roll made with a Ranged
or Thrown weapon while wearing these gloves, you
can take a Reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10
plus your Dexterity modifier if you have a free hand.
If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the ammunition or weapon if it is small enough for you to
hold in that hand.

Gloves of Swimming and Climbing

Handy Haversack
Wondrous Item, Rare

This backpack has a central pouch and two side
pouches, each of which is an extradimensional
space. Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds
of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet.
The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The
haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its
contents.
Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a
Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When
you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the
item is always magically on top.
If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or
torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the
haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever,
although an Artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must
be put right before it can be used again.
Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for
10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of
breathing creatures inside.
Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional
space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole,
or similar item instantly destroys both items and
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind
Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in
a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate
then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be
reopened.

Hat of Disguise

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this hat, you can cast the Disguise
Self spell. The spell ends if the hat is removed.

Hat of Many Spells

Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a
Wizard)
This pointed hat has the following properties.
Spellcasting Focus. While holding the hat, you
can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard
spells. Any spell you cast using the hat gains a special Somatic component: you must reach into the hat
and “pull” the spell out of it.

Unknown Spell. While holding the hat, you can
try to cast a level 1+ spell you don’t know. The spell
must be on the Wizard spell list, it must be of a level
you can cast, and it can’t have Material components
costing more than 1,000 GP. Once you decide on
the spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell’s
level. Then, to determine whether you cast the spell,
make an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus
the spell’s level). On a successful check, you cast the
spell using its normal casting time, and you can’t
use this property again until you finish a Short or
Long Rest. On a failed check, you fail to cast the
spell and a random effect occurs instead, determined by rolling on the following table.
Any spell you cast from the hat uses your spell
save DC and spell attack bonus.

and has the Deafened condition for 1 minute. On a
successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the Cone that

response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard
appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you.
Each spirit uses the Berserker stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0
Hit Points. The spirits look like living, breathing

Horseshoes of a Zephyr
Wondrous Item, Very Rare

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic
action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the
hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the
horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a
horseshoe also takes a Magic action.
While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a
horse or similar creature, they allow the creature
to move normally while floating 4 inches above a
surface. This effect means the creature can cross
or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such
as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and
ignores Difficult Terrain. In addition, the creature
can travel for up to 12 hours a day without gaining
Exhaustion levels from extended travel.

Horseshoes of Speed

Ioun Stone

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic
action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the
hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the
horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a
horseshoe also takes a Magic action.
While all four horseshoes are attached to the
same creature, its Speed is increased by 30 feet.

Roughly marble sized, Ioun Stones are named after
Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on
some worlds. Many types of Ioun Stones exist, each
type a distinct combination of shape and color.
When you take a Magic action to toss an Ioun
Stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at a
distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you
while doing so. You can have up to three Ioun Stones
orbiting your head at the same time.
Each Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered
to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone
avoids contact with other creatures and objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all
attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.
As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any
number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your
Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it’s orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had
dropped it.
The type of stone determines its rarity and
effects.
Absorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender
ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction
to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and
any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the
stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out,
turns dull gray, and loses its magic.
Agility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity increases by
2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep-red sphere
orbits your head.
Awareness (Rare). While this dark-blue rhomboid
orbits your head, you have Advantage on Initiative
rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.
Fortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink
rhomboid orbits your head.
Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head,
you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 8
or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled
spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast
it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses
its magic.
Insight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom increases by
2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue
sphere orbits your head.
Intellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence increases
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet
and blue sphere orbits your head.
Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma increases
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink
and green sphere orbits your head.

Wondrous Item, Rare

Immovable Rod
Rod, Uncommon

This iron rod has a button on one end. You can take
a Utilize action to press the button, which causes
the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you
or another creature takes a Utilize action to push
the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it
defies gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds
of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate
and fall. A creature can take a Utilize action to make
a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check, moving the fixed
rod up to 10 feet on a successful check.

Instant Fortress

Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)

As a Magic action, you can place this 1-inch
adamantine statuette on the ground and, using
a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a
square adamantine tower. Repeating the command
word causes the tower to revert to statuette form,
which works only if the tower is empty. Each creature in the area where the tower appears is pushed
to an unoccupied space outside but next to the
tower. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or
carried are also pushed clear of the tower.
The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high,
with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop
it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder, staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting
them. This ladder, staircase, or ramp ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When created, the tower
has a single door at ground level on the side facing
you. The door opens only at your command, which
you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the
Knock spell and similar magic.
Magic prevents the tower from being tipped over.
The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20;
HP 100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and
Slashing damage except that which is dealt by siege
equipment; and Resistance to all other damage.
Shrinking the tower back down to statuette form
doesn’t repair damage to the tower. Only a Wish
spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell
counts as replicating a spell of level 8 or lower).
Each casting of Wish causes the tower to regain all
its Hit Points.

227

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)

Mastery (Legendary). Your Proficiency Bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your
head.
Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to Armor
Class while this dusty-rose prism orbits your head.
Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 Hit
Points at the end of each hour this pearly white
spindle orbits your head if you have at least 1 Hit
Point.
Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores
spells cast into it, holding them until you use them.
The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time.
When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells
chosen by the GM.
Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4
into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The
spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the
stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is
expended without effect. The level of the slot used
to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
While this stone orbits your head, you can cast
any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level,
spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise
treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from
the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength increases by
2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.
Sustenance (Rare). You don’t need to eat or drink
while this clear spindle orbits your head.

Iron Bands

Wondrous Item, Rare

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action

metal bands.
Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus
equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained
condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a
command that releases it. Doing so or missing with
the attack causes the bands to contract and become
a sphere once more.
A creature that can touch the bands, including the
one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20
Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands.
On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the
Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any
further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.
Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again
until the next dawn.

Iron Flask

Wondrous Item, Legendary
While holding this brass-stoppered iron flask, you
can take a Magic action to target a creature that
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask
is empty and the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be
trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped
by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save.
Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until
released. The flask can hold only one creature at a
time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t age and
doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink.
You can take a Magic action to remove the flask’s
stopper and release the creature in the flask. The
creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour,
understanding those commands even if it doesn’t
know the language in which the commands are
given. If you issue no commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its death
or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise
takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the
creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.
An Identify spell reveals if the flask contains a
creature, but the only way to determine the type
of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered
Iron Flask might already contain a creature chosen
by the GM.

Javelin of Lightning

Weapon (Javelin), Uncommon

Each time you make an attack roll with this magic
weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning damage instead of Piercing damage.
Lightning Bolt. When you throw this weapon at
a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can
forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn
the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms
a 5-foot-wide Line between you and the target. The
target and each other creature in the Line (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half
as much damage on a successful one. Immediately
after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in
your hand. This property can’t be used again until
the next dawn.

Lantern of Revealing

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1
pint of oil, shedding Bright Light in a 30-foot radius
and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible
creatures and objects are visible as long as they are
in the lantern’s Bright Light. You can take a Utilize

action to lower the hood, reducing the lantern’s light
to Dim Light in a 5-foot radius.

Luck Blade

Weapon (Glaive, Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier,
Scimitar, Sickle, or Shortsword), Legendary (Requires
Attunement)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. While the weapon is
on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving
throws.
Luck. If the weapon is on your person, you can call
on its luck (no action required) to reroll one failed
D20 Test if you don’t have the Incapacitated condition. You must use the second roll. Once used, this
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Wish. The weapon has 1d3 charges. While holding
it, you can expend 1 charge and cast Wish from it.
Once used, this property can’t be used again until
the next dawn. The weapon loses this property if it
has no charges.

Mace of Disruption

Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)

When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this magic
weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 Radiant
damage. If the target has 25 Hit Points or fewer
after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC
15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature has the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn.
Light. While you hold this weapon, it sheds Bright
Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.

Mace of Smiting

Weapon (Mace), Rare

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage
rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the weapon to attack a
Construct.
When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with
this weapon, the target takes an extra 7 Bludgeoning damage, or 14 Bludgeoning damage if it’s a
Construct. If a Construct has 25 Hit Points or fewer
after taking this damage, it is destroyed.

Mace of Terror

Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)

This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3
expended charges daily at dawn. While holding
the weapon, you can take a Magic action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it.
Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While

229

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Frightened in this way, a creature must spend its
turns trying to move as far away from you as it can,
and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape
from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it
has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the
Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on
a success.

Mantle of Spell Resistance

Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)

You have Advantage on saving throws against spells
while you wear this cloak.

Manual of Bodily Health
Wondrous Item, Very Rare

This book contains health and nutrition tips, and
its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48
hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the
book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your
Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 30.
The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a
century.

Manual of Gainful Exercise
Wondrous Item, Very Rare

This book describes fitness exercises, and its words
are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over
a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then
loses its magic but regains it in a century.

Manual of Golems

Wondrous Item, Very Rare

This tome contains information and incantations
necessary to make a particular type of golem. The
GM chooses the type or determines it randomly by
rolling on the accompanying table. To decipher and
use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at
least two level 5 spell slots. A creature that can’t
use a Manual of Golems and attempts to read it takes
6d6 Psychic damage.
To create a golem, you must spend the time shown
on the table, working without interruption with the
manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours
per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.
Once you finish creating the golem, the book is
consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes
animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled
on it. See “Monsters” for the golem’s stat block. The
golem is under your control, and it understands and
obeys your commands.

If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or
fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing
its guidelines, your Dexterity increases by 2, to a
maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic
but regains it in a century.

Marvelous Pigments

Wondrous Item, Very Rare

This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment
and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total).
Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment,
you can paint any number of three-dimensional
objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors,
trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided
these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube.
The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you
must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you leave
the Cube before the work is done, all the painted
elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.
When the work is done, all the painted objects
and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a
door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be
opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates
a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within
the 20-foot Cube.
No object created by a pot of pigment can have a
value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all
objects created by a pot of pigment can’t exceed 500
GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a
large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close inspection reveals they’re made from paste, cookies,
or some other worthless material.
If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete
the painting, doing no harm.

Medallion of Thoughts

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)

The medallion has 5 charges. While wearing it, you
can expend 1 charge to cast Detect Thoughts (save
DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d4 expended
charges daily at dawn.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Mirror of Life Trapping
Wondrous Item, Very Rare

When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed
indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC
11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage,
and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.
If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and
you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic
action and use a command word to activate it. It
remains activated until you take a Magic action and
repeat the command word to deactivate it.
Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet
of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma
saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it
is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve
extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the
mirror’s nature makes the save with Advantage,
and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.
An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse
filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10
feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t
age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A
creature trapped within a cell can escape using
magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the
creature is confined to the cell until freed.
If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears
in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror
but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered,
all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.
While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a
Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or
call out a particular cell by number. The creature
named or contained in the named cell appears as an
image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature
can then communicate.
In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and
use a second command word to free one creature
trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears,
along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space
nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.
Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional
space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole,
or similar item instantly destroys both items and
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind
Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The
gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.

Mithral Armor

Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor),
Uncommon
Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Armor made of this
substance can be worn under normal clothes. If the
armor normally imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the
mithral version of the armor doesn’t.

Mysterious Deck

Wondrous Item, Legendary

Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains
a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most
(75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but
some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column
of the Mysterious Deck table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.
Before you draw a card, you must declare how
many cards you intend to draw and then draw them
randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a
card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must
draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number,
the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on
their own and take effect all at once.
Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the
card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the
deck, making it possible to draw the same card
twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)

Each card’s effect is described below.
Balance. You can increase one of your ability
scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also
decrease another one of your ability scores by 2.
You can’t decrease an ability that has a score of 5
or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has
no effect.
Comet. The next time you enter combat against
one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one
of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you
reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat,
you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1
year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0
Hit Points or you don’t choose a foe, this card has no
effect.
Donjon. You disappear and become entombed
in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you’re wearing and
carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts,
which stay behind in the space you occupied when
you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you
are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t
be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell
can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no
more cards.
Euryale. The card’s medusa-like visage curses
you. You take a −2 penalty to saving throws while
cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the
Fates card can end this curse.
Fates. Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never
happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon
as you draw the card or at any other time before
you die.
Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy.
The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you.
This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.
Fool. You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the
next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn’t
count as one of your declared draws.
Gem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000
GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at
your feet.

Jester. You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the
next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards
beyond your declared draws.
Key. A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which
you are proficient appears on your person. The GM
chooses the weapon.
Knight. You gain the service of a Knight, who
magically appears in an unoccupied space you
choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the
same alignment as you and serves you loyally until
death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your GM to create a name
and backstory for this NPC. The GM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.
Moon. You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.
Puzzle. Permanently reduce your Intelligence or
Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You
can draw one additional card beyond your declared
draws.
Rogue. An NPC of the GM’s choice becomes Hostile
toward you. You don’t know the identity of this NPC
until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less
than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the
NPC’s hostility toward you.
Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own,
other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable
property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land
you own are lost in a way that alters reality the
least. Any documentation that proves you should
own something lost to this card also disappears.
Sage. At any time you choose within one year of
drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that
question.
Skull. An Avatar of Death (see the accompanying
stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close
to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with
its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a
tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe.
The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points
or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the
avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death.
The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as
close to that ally as possible and targets only that
ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each
summon only one avatar as a consequence of this
draw. A creature slain by an avatar can’t be restored
to life.
Star. Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a
maximum of 24.
Sun. A magic item (chosen by the GM) appears on
your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit
Points daily at dawn until you die.

232

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Talons. Every magic item you wear or carry
disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish
instead.
Throne. You gain proficiency and Expertise in
your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of
a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the
keep is currently home to one or more monsters,
which must be cleared out before you can claim the
keep as yours.
Void. Your soul is drawn from your body and
contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice.
One or more powerful beings guard the place. While
your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert,
ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A
Wish spell can’t return your soul to your body, but
the spell reveals the location of the object that holds
your soul. You draw no more cards.

Necklace of Adaptation

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have Advantage
on saving throws made to avoid or end the Poisoned
condition.

Necklace of Fireballs

Oathbow

Wondrous Item, Rare

This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it.
You can take a Magic action to detach a bead and
throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end
of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 Fireball (save DC 15).
You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole
necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the
damage of the Fireball by 1d6 for each bead after
the first (maximum 12d6).

Necklace of Prayer Beads

Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a
Cleric, Druid, or Paladin)

This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from
aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many
nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber,
bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a
magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead
loses its magic.
Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the
type of each bead on the necklace or determines it
randomly by rolling on the table below. A necklace
can have more than one bead of the same type. To
use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each
bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a
Bonus Action (using your spell save DC if a save is
necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that
bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon.
Life Stealing. The weapon has 1d8 + 1 charges.
When you attack a creature that has fewer than
100 Hit Points with this weapon and roll a 20 on the
d20 for the attack roll, the creature must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain
instantly as the sword tears its life force from its
body. Constructs and Undead succeed on the save
automatically. The weapon loses 1 charge if the
creature is slain. When the weapon has no charges
remaining, it loses this property.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires
Attunement)
When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in
Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use
this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can utter
or sign the following command words: “Swift death
to you who have wronged me.” The target of your
attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or
until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such
sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy
dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.
When you make a ranged attack roll with this
weapon against your sworn enemy, you have Advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no
benefit from Half Cover or Three-Quarters Cover,
and you suffer no Disadvantage due to long range.
If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra
3d6 Piercing damage.
While your sworn enemy lives, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.

Oil of Etherealness
Potion, Rare

One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller
creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and
carrying (one additional vial is required for each
size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes
10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the
effect of the Etherealness spell for 1 hour.
Beads of this cloudy, gray oil form on the outside
of its container and quickly evaporate.

Oil of Sharpness
Potion, Very Rare

One vial of this oil can coat one Melee weapon or
twenty pieces of ammunition, but only ammunition
and Melee weapons that are nonmagical and deal
Slashing or Piercing damage are affected. Applying
the oil takes 1 minute, after which the oil magically
seeps into whatever it coats, turning the coated
weapon into a +3 Weapon or the coated ammunition
into +3 Ammunition.
This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny,
ultrathin silver shards.

Oil of Slipperiness
Potion, Uncommon

One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller
creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and
carrying (one additional vial is required for each
size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes
10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the Freedom of Movement spell for 8 hours.
Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground
as a Magic action, where it covers a 10-foot square,

duplicating the effect of the Grease spell in that area
for 8 hours.
This sticky, black unguent is thick and heavy, but
it flows quickly when poured.

Pearl of Power

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by
a Spellcaster)
While this pearl is on your person, you can take a
Magic action to regain one expended spell slot of
level 3 or lower. Once you use the pearl, it can’t be
used again until the next dawn.

Periapt of Health

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)

While wearing this pendant, you can take a Magic
action to regain 2d4 + 2 Hit Points. Once used, this
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
In addition, you have Advantage on saving throws
to avoid or end the Poisoned condition while you
wear this pendant.

Periapt of Proof against Poison

Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)

This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black
gem pendant. While you wear it, you have Immunity
to the Poisoned condition and Poison damage.

Periapt of Wound Closure

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)

While wearing this pendant, you gain the following
benefits.
Life Preservation. Whenever you make a Death
Saving Throw, you can change a roll of 9 or lower to
a 10, turning a failed save into a successful one.
Natural Healing Boost. Whenever you roll a Hit
Point Die to regain Hit Points, double the number of
Hit Points it restores.

Philter of Love

Potion, Uncommon

The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes
after drinking this philter, you are charmed by that
creature and have the Charmed condition for 1
hour.
This rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one
easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.

Pipes of the Sewers

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)

While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rats
and giant rats are Indifferent toward you and won’t
attack you unless you threaten or harm them.
The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes
as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus Action to
expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one Swarm
of Rats with each expended charge if enough rats
are within half a mile of you to be called in this
fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t
enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted.
Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control
otherwise.
Whenever a Swarm of Rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you
while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful
save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and
can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24
hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the
pipes’ music and becomes Friendly to you and your
allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes
each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm
obeys your commands. If you issue no commands

Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Legendary
(Requires Attunement)

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

While you’re wearing this armor, you can take a
Magic action and use a command word to gain the
effect of the Etherealness spell. The spell ends immediately if you remove the armor or take a Magic action to repeat the command word. This property of
the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.

These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can take a Magic

Portable Hole

Wondrous Item, Rare

extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical
space within the hole exists on a different plane
of existence, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole
can exit the hole by climbing out of it.
You can take a Magic action to close a Portable
Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and
folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and
any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the
hole weighs next to nothing.
If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s
extradimensional space can take an action to make
a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful
check, the creature forces its way out and appears
within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable
Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.
Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional
space created by a Bag of Holding, Handy Haversack,
or similar item instantly destroys both items and
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind
Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in
a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate
then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be
reopened.

Rod of Absorption

Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
While holding this rod, you can take a Reaction to
absorb a spell that is targeting only you and doesn’t
create an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s effect
is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same
level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell
dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to
cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up
to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence.
Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod
can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.
When you become attuned to the rod, you know
how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed
over the course of its existence and how many levels
of spell energy it currently has stored.
If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can
convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast
spells you have prepared or know. You can create
spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your
own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use
the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise
cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3
levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot.
A newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of
spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer
absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining
becomes nonmagical.

Rod of Alertness

Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

This rod has the following properties.
Alertness. While holding the rod, you have
Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on
Initiative rolls.
Spells. While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:

241

Detect Evil and Good
Detect Magic
Detect Poison and Disease
See Invisibility

Protective Aura. As a Magic action, you can plant
the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon
the rod’s head sheds Bright Light in a 60-foot radius
and Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. While in
that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1

System Reference Document 5.2.1

bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can
sense the location of any Invisible creature that is
also in the Bright Light.
The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends
after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a Magic
action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used,
this property can’t be used again until the next
dawn.

Rod of Lordly Might

Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)

This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a

and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are
set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.
Buttons. You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a button’s effect lasts until
you push a different button or until you push the
same button again, which causes the rod to revert
to its normal form:

Button 1. A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head. The flames shed
Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for
an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as
a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice)
that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.
Button 2. The rod’s flanged head folds down and
two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants
a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made
with it.
Button 3. The rod’s flanged head folds down, a
spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the
rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a
+3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made
with it.
Button 4. The rod transforms into a climbing pole
up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though
the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In
surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole.
Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the
sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can
bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of
solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its
normal form.
Button 5. The rod transforms into a handheld
battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus
to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break
through doors, barricades, and other barriers.
Button 6. The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing
happens if this function of the rod is used in a

location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also
gives you knowledge of your approximate depth
beneath the ground or your height above it.

Drain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee
attack using the rod, you can force the target to
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to
half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Paralyze. When you hit a creature with a melee
attack using the rod, you can force the target to
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the target has the Paralyzed condition for 1
minute. The target repeats the save at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
Once used, this property can’t be used again until
the next dawn.
Terrify. While holding the rod, you can take a
Magic action to force each creature you can see
within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the
Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened
target repeats the save at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once
used, this property can’t be used again until the
next dawn.

Rod of Resurrection

Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)

The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can
cast one of the following spells from it: Heal (expends 1 charge) or Resurrection (expends 5 charges).
The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn.
If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the
rod disappears in a harmless burst of radiance.

Rod of Rulership

Rod, Rare (Requires Attunement)

You can take a Magic action to present the rod and
command obedience from each creature of your
choice that you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw or have the Charmed condition for 8
hours. While Charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or
your allies or commanded to do something contrary
to its nature, a target ceases to be Charmed in this
way. Once used, this property can’t be used again
until the next dawn.

Rod of Security
Rod, Very Rare

242

While holding this rod, you can take a Magic action
to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you
and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see
to a demiplane. You choose the form the demiplane

System Reference Document 5.2.1

takes. It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern,
an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless
of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water
and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane’s
environment can’t harm its occupants. Everything
else that can be interacted with there can exist
only there. For example, a flower picked from a
garden there disappears if it is taken outside the
demiplane.
For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor
regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die.
Also, creatures don’t age while there, although time
passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to
200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).
When the time runs out or you take a Magic action
to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod or an
unoccupied space nearest that location. Once used,
this property can’t be used again until 10 days have
passed.

Rope of Climbing

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

This 60-foot length of rope can hold up to 3,000
pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can
take a Magic action to command the other end of the
rope to animate and move toward a destination you
choose, up to the rope’s length away from you. That
end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet at the start of each of your subsequent turns until reaching its destination or until
you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten
itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to
knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.
If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at
1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the
rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advantage on ability checks made to climb using the rope.
The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every
5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the
rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.

Rope of Entanglement
Wondrous Item, Rare

This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of
the rope, you can take a Magic action to command
the other end to dart forward and entangle one
creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The
target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw or have the Restrained condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope
(causing the rope to coil up in the target’s space)
or by using a Bonus Action to repeat the command
(causing the rope to coil up in your hand).

A target Restrained by the rope can take an action
to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check,
the target is no longer Restrained by the rope. If
you’re still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a Reaction to command
the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope
coils up in the target’s space.
The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every
5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the
rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.

Scarab of Protection

Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)

This beetle-shaped medallion provides three benefits while it is on your person.
Defense. You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
Preservation. The scarab has 12 charges. If you
fail a saving throw against a Necromancy spell or
a harmful effect originating from an Undead, you
can take a Reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the
failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last
charge is expended.
Spell Resistance. You have Advantage on saving
throws against spells.

Scimitar of Speed

Weapon (Scimitar), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls
made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can
make one attack with it as a Bonus Action on each of
your turns.

Sending Stones

Wondrous Item, Uncommon

Sending Stones come in pairs, with each stone
carved to match the other so the pairing is easily
recognized. While you touch one stone, you can cast
Sending from it. The target is the bearer of the other
stone. If no creature bears the other stone, you
know that fact as soon as you use the stone, and you
don’t cast the spell.
Once Sending is cast using either stone, the stones
can’t be used again until the next dawn. If one of the
stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes
nonmagical.

Sentinel Shield

Armor (Shield), Uncommon

While holding this Shield, you have Advantage on
Initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.
The Shield is emblazoned with a symbol of an eye.

243

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Shield, +1, +2, or +3

Armor (Shield), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2), or Very
Rare (+3)
While holding this Shield, you have a bonus to Armor Class determined by the Shield’s rarity, in addition to the Shield’s normal bonus to AC.

Shield of Missile Attraction

Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)

While holding this Shield, you have Resistance to
damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.
Curse. This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses
you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell
or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to
end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a
Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet
of you, the curse causes you to become the target
instead.

Shield of the Cavalier

Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

While holding this Shield, you have a +2 bonus to
Armor Class. This bonus is in addition to the Shield’s
normal bonus to AC.
The Shield has the following additional properties
that you can use while holding it.
Forceful Bash. When you take the Attack action,
you can make one of the attack rolls using the Shield
against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your
Proficiency Bonus and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Force damage to
the target equal to 2d6 + 2 plus your Strength modifier, and if the target is a creature, you can push
it up to 10 feet directly away from yourself. If the
creature is your size or smaller, you can also knock
it down, giving it the Prone condition.
Protective Field. As a Reaction, when you or an
ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by
an attack or makes a saving throw against an area
of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot Emanation originating from you. When
the Emanation appears, any creatures or objects not
fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest
unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of
effect that triggered the Reaction has no effect on
creatures and objects inside the Emanation, which
lasts as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1
minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the Emanation. A creature or object inside the Emanation can’t
be damaged by attacks or effects originating from
outside, nor can a creature inside the Emanation
damage anything outside it. Once this property is
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Slippers of Spider Climbing

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While you wear these light shoes, you can move
up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along
ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a
Climb Speed equal to your Speed. However, the slippers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery
surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.

Sovereign Glue

Wondrous Item, Legendary

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It
must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated
inside with Oil of Slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.
One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square
surface. Applying an ounce of Sovereign Glue takes
a Utilize action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute
to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be
broken only by the application of Universal Solvent
or Oil of Etherealness, or with a Wish spell.

Spellguard Shield

Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

While holding this Shield, you have Advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical
effects, and spell attack rolls have Disadvantage
against you.

Spell Scroll

Scroll, Rarity Varies

A Spell Scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your spell
list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without Material components. Otherwise, the scroll is
unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll
requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the
spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll isn’t lost.
If the spell is on your spell list but of a higher level
than you can normally cast, you make an ability
check using your spellcasting ability to determine
whether you cast the spell. The DC equals 10 plus
the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.
The level of the spell on the scroll determines the
spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as
the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the following table.

Copying a Scroll into a Spellbook. A Wizard spell
on a Spell Scroll can be copied into a spellbook.
When a spell is copied in this way, the copier must
succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a
DC equal to 10 plus the spell’s level. On a successful
check, the spell is copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the Spell Scroll is destroyed.

Sphere of Annihilation
Wondrous Item, Legendary

This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the
multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a
magical field surrounding it.
The sphere obliterates all matter it passes
through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it
passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else
that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed
and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.
Controlling the Sphere. A Sphere of Annihilation is
stationary until someone takes control of it. If you
are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic
action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check.
On a successful check, you control the sphere until
the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature’s control, that creature loses control
of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves
10 feet toward you in a straight line.
While in control of the sphere, you can take a
Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction
of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to
5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5
feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters
must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw
or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A
creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is
obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no
other physical remains.
Sphere Interactions. If the sphere comes into
contact with a planar portal (such as that created by
the Gate spell) or an extradimensional space (such
as that within a Portable Hole), the GM determines
randomly what happens using the following table.

1d100

Staff of Frost

01–50 The sphere is destroyed.
51–85 The sphere moves through the portal or into
the extradimensional space.
86–00 A spatial rift sends the sphere and each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere
to a random plane of existence.

Languages from it using your spell save DC.

throw against an Enchantment spell that targets
only you, you can take a Reaction to expend 1
charge from the staff and turn the spell back on
its caster as if you had cast the spell.

against an Enchantment spell that targets only
you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can’t use this property of the staff

take Force damage equal to 16 times the number
of charges in the staff. Each other creature in the
area makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a

Strike (see below).

Staff of the Python

Staff, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)

As a Magic action, you can throw this staff so that it
lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you,
causing the staff to become a Giant Constrictor
Snake in that space. The snake is under your control and shares your Initiative count, taking its turn
immediately after yours.
On your turn, you can mentally command the
snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of
you and you don’t have the Incapacitated condition.
You decide what action the snake takes and where it
moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general
command, such as to attack your enemies or guard
a location. Absent commands from you, the snake
defends itself.
As a Bonus Action, you can command the snake
to revert to staff form in its current space, and you
can’t use the staff’s property again for 1 hour. If the
snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts
to its staff form; the staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before
losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.

Tree Form. You can take a Magic action to plant

and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into
a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a
5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top
spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears
ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation
magic that can be discerned with the Detect Magic
spell. While touching the tree and using a Magic
action, you return the staff to its normal form. Any
creature in the tree falls when the tree reverts to
a staff.
Regaining Charges. The staff regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last
charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.

Staff of Thunder and Lightning
Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff
that grants a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage
rolls made with it. It also has the following additional properties. Once one of these properties is
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Lightning. When you hit with a melee attack
using the staff, you can cause the target to take an
extra 2d6 Lightning damage (no action required).
Thunder. When you hit with a melee attack using
the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of
thunder audible out to 300 feet (no action required).
The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the Stunned condition
until the end of your next turn.

Thunder and Lightning. Immediately after you
hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can take
a Bonus Action to use the Lightning and Thunder
properties (see above) at the same time. Doing so
doesn’t expend the daily use of those properties,
only the use of this one.
Lightning Strike. You can take a Magic action to
cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff’s tip
in a Line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each
creature in that Line makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 Lightning damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Thunderclap. You can take a Magic action to
cause the staff to produce a thunderclap audible out

When you use this weapon to attack a creature
that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the d20
for the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s
heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without
the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect
if it has Immunity to Slashing damage, if it doesn’t
have or need a head, or if the GM decides that the
creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this
weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 30
Slashing damage from the hit. If the creature has
Legendary Resistance, it can expend one daily use
of that trait to avoid losing its head, taking the extra
damage instead.

to determine the target’s new form. On a 1,
the new form is a Black Bear; on a 2, the
new form is a Giant Wasp; on a 3–4, the new

Monsters
Stat Block Overview
A monster has a stat block that contains the rules
necessary to use it in the game. Stat blocks are divided into the following parts:

Name and General Details. The name of the monster is followed by its size, creature type (along
with any descriptive tags), and alignment.
Combat Highlights. Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed,
and Initiative are provided here.
Ability Scores. A monster’s ability scores, ability
modifiers, and saving throws are listed here.
Other Details. The monster’s Senses, Languages,
and CR entries appear here. Additional details appear in some monsters, such as skill proficiencies,
Resistances, Immunities, and Gear. If a monster
lacks those details, entries for them don’t appear.
Traits. Monster characteristics that are active at all
times or during certain situations appear here.
Actions. The monster can take the actions here in
addition to those in “Playing the Game.”
Bonus Actions. This section provides a monster’s
Bonus Actions, if any.
Reactions and Legendary Actions. These sections
provide Reactions and Legendary Actions, if any.

Parts of a Stat Block

The rules for a stat block are detailed in “Rules Glossary” and in this section.

Size

A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge,
or Gargantuan. If size options are presented, you
choose the creature’s size from those options. See
“Playing the Game” for information on size.

Creature Type

Each monster has a tag that identifies the type of
creature it is. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type.
The game includes the following creature types,
which have no rules of their own:

Aberrations are utterly alien beings, such as aboleths and cloakers.
Beasts are non-Humanoid natural creatures, like
horses and wolves, as well as most giant animals.
Celestials are magical creatures, such as angels and
pegasi, with ties to the Upper Planes.
Constructs are magically created creatures such as
homunculi and shield guardians.
Dragons are scaly beings of ancient origin, such as
red dragons and wyverns.

254

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Elementals are beings from the Elemental Planes,
such as efreet and water elementals.
Fey are creatures tied to the Feywild or the forces
of nature, such as dryads and goblins.
Fiends are creatures tied to terrifying Lower
Planes, such as balors and hell hounds.
Giants are towering beings with humanlike shapes,
like fire giants and trolls.
Humanoids are people defined by their roles and
professions, such as mages, pirates, and warriors.
They include members of varied species.
Monstrosities are unnatural creatures with
strange origins, such as mimics and owlbears.
Oozes are gelatinous creatures, including black
puddings and gelatinous cubes.
Plants are sentient vegetation and fungal monsters,
such as shambling mounds and treants.
Undead are spirits and the reanimated dead, such
as ghosts, vampires, and zombies.

Descriptive Tags

A monster might have one or more tags in parentheses following its type. Such tags provide additional
categorization and have no rules of their own, but
certain game effects might refer to them.

Alignment

The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is
a default suggestion of how to roleplay the monster,
inspired by its traditional role in the game or real-​
world folklore. Change a monster’s alignment to
suit your storytelling needs. The Neutral alignment,
in particular, is an invitation for you to consider
whether an individual leans toward one of the other
alignments.
“Character Creation” describes the nine alignments and unaligned creatures.

Armor Class

A monster’s Armor Class (AC) includes its natural
armor, Dexterity, gear, and other defenses. See
“Playing the Game” for information on Armor Class.

Initiative

The Initiative entry specifies the monster’s Initiative modifier followed by the monster’s Initiative
score in parentheses. Use the modifier when you
roll to determine a monster’s Initiative. A monster’s
Initiative modifier is typically equal to its Dexterity
modifier, but some monsters have additional modifiers, such as Proficiency Bonus, applied to that
number.
If you don’t want to roll a monster’s Initiative, use
the Initiative score as the monster’s Initiative in
combat. Initiative is further detailed in “Playing the
Game.”

Hit Points
A monster’s Hit Points are presented as a number
followed by parentheses, where the monster’s Hit
Point Dice are provided, along with any contribution from its Constitution. Either use the number for
the monster’s Hit Points or roll the die expression in
parentheses to determine the monster’s Hit Points
randomly; don’t use both.
A monster’s size typically determines the die used
to calculate its Hit Points, as shown in the Hit Dice
by Size table.

A monster’s Constitution modifier is multiplied by
the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result
is added to its Hit Points. For example, if a monster
has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit
Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 Hit Points (average 11).
For more on Hit Points, see “Playing the Game.”

Speed

The Speed entry specifies a monster’s Speed. Some
monsters have one or more of the following speeds:
Burrow, Climb, Fly, Swim. Rules for Speed and these
specials speeds appear in “Rules Glossary.”

Ability Scores

Every monster has six ability scores along with
corresponding ability score modifiers and saving
throw modifiers. For more information on ability
scores and saving throws, see “Playing the Game.”

Skills

The Skills entry specifies a monster’s skill proficiencies, if any. For example, a monster that is very
perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A
skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability
modifier and its Proficiency Bonus. Other modifiers
might apply.

Resistances and Vulnerabilities

These entries list a monster’s Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if any. See “Playing the Game” for more
information.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Running a Monster
To ensure a monster acts in accordance with its
Challenge Rating, follow these rules during combat:

Special Abilities. If the monster has a special ability that deals a lot of damage but has a limited
number of uses, such as a recharging breath
weapon or a spell it can cast only once per day,
have it use that special ability as quickly and as
often as possible.
Multiattack. If the monster has Multiattack, have
it use Multiattack on any of its turns in which
it’s not using one of its more powerful abilities.
Bonus Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions. If
the monster has Bonus Actions, Reactions, or
Legendary Actions in its stat block, make sure it
uses them as often as it can.

Immunities
This entry lists the monster’s Immunities, if any. If
the monster has damage and condition Immunities,
the damage types are listed before the conditions.
See “Playing the Game” for details.

Gear

Monsters have proficiency with their equipment. If
a monster has equipment that can be given away or
retrieved, the items are listed in the Gear entry. The
monster’s stat block might include special flourishes that happen when the monster uses an item,
and the stat block might ignore the rules in “Equipment” for that item. When used by someone else, a
retrievable item uses its “Equipment” rules, ignoring any special flourishes in the stat block.
The Gear entry doesn’t necessarily list all of a
monster’s equipment. For example, a monster that
wears clothes is assumed to be dressed appropriately, and those clothes aren’t in this entry.
Equipment mentioned outside the Gear entry is
considered to be supernatural or highly specialized,
and it is unusable when the monster is defeated.

Ammunition and Ranged Attacks

A monster that requires ammunition to make
ranged attacks carries the necessary ammunition.

Equipping a Monster with Other Items

You may equip monsters with additional gear however you like, using the items in “Equipment” for
inspiration. You decide how much of a monster’s
equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain
and whether any of that equipment is still usable.
Beware of giving a monster combat-oriented
magic items, since those might alter the monster’s
Challenge Rating. If you do give a monster a magic
item, the monster can have Attunement with magic
items as noted in “Equipment.” A monster with

a class tag after its creature type is considered a
member of that class for Attunement purposes.

Senses

The Senses entry specifies a monster’s Passive
Perception score, as well as any special senses the
monster possesses. Passive Perception and special
senses are described in “Rules Glossary.”

Languages

This entry lists languages that the monster can use
to communicate. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t communicate with it,
which is noted in its entry. “None” indicates that a
creature doesn’t comprehend any language.

Traits

Challenge Rating is defined in “Rules Glossary,”
while guidance on using CR to plan potential combat encounters is in “Gameplay Toolbox.”

A monster’s traits, if any, are features that are active at all times or in certain situations.

Experience Points

The number of Experience Points (XP) a monster
is worth is based on its CR, as detailed in the Experience Points by Challenge Rating table. XP is
awarded for defeating the monster in combat or
otherwise neutralizing it.
Unless a rule says otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or another magical ability is worth
the XP noted in its stat block.

Actions

A monster can take the actions in this section or
take one of the actions available to all creatures, as
described in “Playing the Game.”

Attack Notation

The entry for a monster’s attack identifies whether
the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then
provides the attack roll’s bonus, its reach or range,
and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one
target unless its entry says otherwise. For details
on different kinds of attacks, see “Playing the Game”
and “Spells.”
Hit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur
as a result of an attack hitting a target are described
after the “Hit:” notation.
Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a
miss, that information follows the “Miss:” notation.
Hit or Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs
regardless of whether it hits or misses its target,
that information follows the “Hit or Miss:” notation.

Saving Throw Effect Notation

If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect identifies the kind of save required and then provides the
save’s DC, a description of which creatures make
the save, and an explanation of what happens on a
failed or successful save.
“Half damage only” on a successful save means
the target takes half as much damage (round down)
as targets that fail the save, while also ignoring all
other parts of the effect.

Damage Notation
A stat block usually provides both a number and a
die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a
hit. You decide whether to use the number or the die
expression in parentheses; don’t use both.

Multiattack

Some creatures can make more than one attack
when they take the Attack action. Such creatures
have the Multiattack entry in the “Actions” section
of their stat block. This entry details the attacks a
creature can make, as well as any additional abilities it can use, as part of the Attack action.

Spellcasting

If a monster can cast any spells, its stat block lists
the spells and provides the monster’s spellcasting
ability, spell save DC (if any spells require a saving
throw), and spell attack bonus (if any spells require
an attack roll). Unless noted otherwise, a spell of
level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest possible
level and can’t be cast at a higher level.
A monster’s spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a green hag can cast the Invisibility spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction,
which means the spell affects only the hag.
Spell Components. The Spellcasting trait notes
whether the monster’s spellcasting ignores the
need for certain spell components. If any spell components are required, describe the monster’s use of
Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal to
characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that
requires Material components has them.
Casting Times of 1+ Minutes. If a spell has a casting time of 1 minute or more yet is listed in a spellcasting action, the monster doesn’t cast the spell in
just one action unless the action’s description states
otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action
on each of its turns and maintain Concentration to
cast the spell, as described in “Rules Glossary.”

Bonus Action

If a monster has Bonus Action options, they are
listed in this section. See “Playing the Game” for details on Bonus Actions.

257

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Reactions
If the monster has Reaction options, those are listed
in this section along with their triggers. See “Playing the Game” for details on Reactions.

Legendary Actions

If the monster has Legendary Action options, those
are listed in this section. A Legendary Action is an
action that a monster can take immediately after
another creature’s turn. Only one of these actions
can be taken at a time and only after another creature’s turn ends. The monster can’t take a Legendary Action if it has the Incapacitated condition or is
otherwise unable to take actions.
The monster has a limited number of Legendary
Action uses, and that number is specified in the
stat block. The monster expends one use whenever
it takes a Legendary Action, and it regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

Limited Usage

Some parts of a stat block have restrictions on the
number of times they can be used. Here are the
most common ways that usage is limited:

X/Day. This notation means the stat block part can
be used a certain number of times (represented
by X) and that a monster must finish a Long Rest
to regain expended uses. For example, a Reaction
that includes “1/Day” means the Reaction can be
taken once and that the monster must finish a
Long Rest to take it again.
Recharge X–Y. This notation means a monster
can use the stat block part once. At the start of
each of the monster’s turns, roll 1d6. If the roll
is within the number range given in the notation
(represented by X–Y), the monster regains the use
of that part, which also recharges when the monster finishes a Short or Long Rest. For example,
“Recharge 5–6” in an action means a monster can
take the action once. Then, at the start of each of
the monster’s turns, it regains the use of that action if it rolls a 5 or 6 on 1d6.
Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This notation means the monster can use the stat block
part once and must then finish a Short or Long
Rest to use it again.

Traits
Amphibious. The aboleth can breathe air and water.

Dominate Mind (2/Day). Wisdom Saving Throw: DC
16, one creature the aboleth can see within 30 feet.
Failure: The target has the Charmed condition until
the aboleth dies or is on a different plane of existence
from the target. While Charmed, the target acts as an
ally to the aboleth and is under its control while within
60 feet of it. In addition, the aboleth and the target
can communicate telepathically with each other over
any distance.
The target repeats the save whenever it takes damage
as well as after every 24 hours it spends at least 1 mile
away from the aboleth, ending the effect on itself on
a success.

Legendary Actions
Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after
another creature’s turn, the aboleth can expend a use to
take one of the following actions. The aboleth regains all
expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

Eldritch Restoration. If destroyed, the aboleth gains
a new body in 5d10 days, reviving with all its Hit
Points in the Far Realm or another location chosen
by the GM.

Lash. The aboleth makes one Tentacle attack.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair). If
the aboleth fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Air Elemental

Mucus Cloud. While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by mucus. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 14,
each creature in a 5-foot Emanation originating from
the aboleth at the end of the aboleth’s turn. Failure: The
target is cursed. Until the curse ends, the target’s skin
becomes slimy, the target can breathe air and water,
and it can’t regain Hit Points unless it is underwater.
While the cursed creature is outside a body of water,
the creature takes 6 (1d12) Acid damage at the end of
every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to its skin
before those minutes have passed.
Probing Telepathy. If a creature the aboleth can see
communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature’s greatest desires.

Actions
Multiattack. The aboleth makes two Tentacle attacks
and uses either Consume Memories or Dominate Mind
if available.
Tentacle. Melee Attack Roll: +9, reach 15 ft. Hit: 12
(2d6 + 5) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large
or smaller creature, it has the Grappled condition (escape DC 14) from one of four tentacles.
Consume Memories. Intelligence Saving Throw: DC 16,
one creature within 30 feet that is Charmed or Grappled by the aboleth. Failure: 10 (3d6) Psychic damage.

258

Success: Half damage. Failure or Success: The aboleth
gains the target’s memories if the target is a Humanoid
and is reduced to 0 Hit Points by this action.

System Reference Document 5.2.1

Psychic Drain. If the aboleth has at least one creature
Charmed or Grappled, it uses Consume Memories and
regains 5 (1d10) Hit Points.
