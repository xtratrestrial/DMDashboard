Destruction of property, by such means as arson or mere vandalism
41-50
Identical but otherwise trivial thefts of a particular sort of object, or from a particular type of person, and/or
use of a particular and unusual method of theft (c.f., the Grey Mouser’s thefts of candles and carpets in Fritz
Leiber’s short stories).

Unplanned assaults committed when the opportunity arises (e.g., villain is a serial killer, a highwayman, an
ambusher, or a violent kleptomaniac)
