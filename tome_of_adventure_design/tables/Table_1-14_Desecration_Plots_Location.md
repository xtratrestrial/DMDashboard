Table 1-14: Desecration Plots (Location)

01-10
Conquest. Villain plans to conquer and occupy the holy site by military assault; using a frontal attack,
infiltration, or the help of a traitor.
11-20
Nullification From Afar. The villain plans to counteract the power of a holy site with activities he can
perform in another location. Examples might include such things as building a dark mirror-image location as
a counteracting force, or summoning clouds to hang permanently over a sun temple. Possibilities for this are
pretty vast.
21-30
Raze it to the Ground. The villain plans to physically destroy a temple or holy site using an earthquake,
burning it, exploding it, or using some other implement of physical destruction other than a frontal assault.
31-40
Seed of Evil. The villain plans to desecrate the temple or holy site by planting an unholy object on the
premises, probably in a hidden place (but also, possibly, substituting something in plain sight with a duplicate).
He might replace the eye of an idol with the eye of a demon, perhaps he might bury the body of a hanged
murderer under the altar, or perhaps a stone soaked in the cursed waters of La’aashoon might be used to
replace a flagstone.
41-50
Stealing the Relics. The villain plans to steal or modify the specific holy item that gives a temple or a holy
site its power or significance. He might be planning to replace it with a worthless forgery, or he might plan just
to hide it away. This is a good plot to introduce two levels of villain – the one who is supposed to arrange the
actual theft, and a more powerful master who plans to use or destroy the relic.
51-60
Target the Congregation. The villain plans to subvert or convert the temple’s congregation into attacking
the priests or otherwise destroying the temple or holy site.
61-70
Target the Priesthood (Guile). The villain plans to eliminate or remove the servants of a holy site by
trickery, then occupy, desecrate, or destroy the site. He might do so by impersonating a messenger from the high
priesthood calling the priests away to an emergency conclave, perhaps. A nearby “natural” disaster might also
be used as the decoy.

Target the Priesthood (Stealth). The villain plans to eliminate the servants of a holy site by stealthy means,
allowing him to occupy, desecrate, or destroy the site at leisure. He might even keep the site open for business
afterwards! This sort of plot might include assassinations, kidnappings, disguised replacements for the missing
priests, or man other kinds of nefarious doings.
Wrath of the Wings
81-90
Target the Priesthood (Subvert). The villain plans to subvert the priesthood to evil, and use them to
desecrate the temple. For ideas about his methods, you might want to take a look at the “Conversion” and
“Subversion” tables (Table 1-13 and Table 1-32)
91-00
Unholy Event. The villain plans to desecrate the temple or holy site by causing some unholy action to
take place there. Examples might include a human sacrifice, the speaking of ancient or blasphemous words,
summoning a demon within the precincts, or a formal rededication of the temple to an evil deity. Most such
plots would require someone to get into the site, although it might not need to be the villain himself.
