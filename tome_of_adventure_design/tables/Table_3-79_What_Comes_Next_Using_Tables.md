TRICKS
The “Trick” is a very broad concept in adventure design, and I’m not going to try to define it exactly. In general, a trick is
something that requires the players to make meaningful decisions but that isn’t a monster or a trap. Tricks can range all the way
from a sliding corridor to a riddle written on a scrap of parchment.
There are about an infinite number of ways to try and break down the broad concept of a dungeon trick into a series of
tables. After literally years of screwing around with it, I’ve decided to compile my tables into eleven categories: Architectural
Tricks, Bargain and Persuasion Tricks, Experiment Tricks, False Appearance Tricks, Hazard Tricks, Magic Area Tricks, Magic
Thing Tricks, Run-the-Gauntlet Tricks, Substance Tricks, Wager and Game Tricks, and Written Tricks. There is a great deal of
crossover between these categories, too, so don’t approach these tables as if each category is a formula.

profile of a trick, ignoring everything else in this section.
Hints and Foreshadowings. These tables can be used for all the categories, so they come
first.
The Separate Categories (each with sub-tables):
•
Architectural Tricks
Bargain and Persuasion Tricks
Experiment Tricks
False Appearance Tricks
Hazard Tricks
Magic Area Tricks
Magic Thing Tricks
Run-the-Gauntlet Tricks
Substance Tricks
Wager and Game Tricks.
Written Tricks
General Subtables. Certain categories make reference to the same
sub-tables, so these are gathered together at the end of the section.

METHOD 1: THE WILD CARD MATRIX
This table is not for the faint of heart – it’s used to generate the overall profile of a trick with absolutely no rhyme or reason,
instead of picking a category and working from there. Roll for each component of the trick (hints, structure, rewards, risks, and
solutions), then put them together in any way that your inspiration takes you.
