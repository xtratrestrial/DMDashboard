Strange and

Blades. Possibly whirling, possibly moving about
randomly, possibly responding to actions taken by
characters.
Counteraction

Jungle gym (doesn’t actually look like a jungle gym,
of course). This is a test of movement through an
obstacle course possibly involving slides, climbing,
and getting through crawlways.
11-20
Mental test such as riddles. This could include 5050 chances – for example, in Alice in Wonderland,
Alice is confronted with a cake that says “Eat me”
and a bottle that says “Drink me.” She is too big to
get through the mousehole at her present size, but
guessing correctly whether the labels are trustworthy
is one example of this sort of trick: the rule is to
figure out which food/drink increases/decreases size,
the reward is getting through the mousehole, and the
Risk is “Transformation,” as described in the next
column.
Falling rocks and floors. This can also involve statues
tipping onto the characters, walls closing in, etc.
Random Progression. Characters have to pick one
random thing (card, runestone, roll dice, etc) and
face the consequences. Then they are done, and have
gotten through the trick. If the process repeats more
than once, the trick is more in the nature of a Game
Board Pathway (see below).
Monsters. Probably the monsters are themed in some
way to the nature of the gauntlet. They might all be
stone-related, elemental-related, woodland-related,
undead, etc. The monsters might or might not be
“active” at the beginning of the test. Successive failures
of the Rule of Passage might, for example, keep
opening up chutes filled with giant rats.
Figure out which symbol means “safety.”
Rays or bursts of magic with different results. Maybe
there is a floating orb that reacts to movement which
continues more than 4 seconds, for instance, if the
Rule of Passage is to Move Only at the Right Time.

Curses that can be removed on the other side, that stay
with the character for a certain amount of time, that
stay with the character until leaving the dungeon, that
stay with the character until something particular is
done in the dungeon (pushing the eye of the statue, or
whatever), or stay with the character until the curse is
removed normally.

Take cover behind obstacles (possibly having to
identify which things will give adequate cover and
which won’t). Possibly, the characters would need to
figure out how to activate the “cover.” For example,
putting a shield into the hands of a statue causes the
statue to block the death rays. There might even be a
“trade” of some kind at each place offering potential
cover. Perhaps the statue doesn’t give back the shield,
and the next statue wants money, and the next statue
wants rations, etc.
Transformations. People are turned into something
else, and have to manage to get through the area in
that animal (or other) form. They could also, in some
way, be turned into obstacles that hinder the rest of
the group. If the trick is a chessboard where the only
safe way to move is diagonally, a character who moves
straight might be encased in a block of stone that
blocks off his square. If someone reaches the other
side, the block of stone might disappear and release
the trapped character. Shrinking or growing would be
included here.
61-70
Stand in the right place: certain places are safe and/
or profitable, others are dangerous, unprofitable, or
subject to the “risk” defined in the next column. This
probably follows a pattern. The standard example of
this would be the task of getting across a chessboard
using only the “bishop’s move” of moving diagonally
only.
Falling. In this case, the Rule of Passage is probably
linked to maintaining one’s balance or not having a
support give way beneath them. Bridges over lava pits
blocked by a monster with a big club, green and yellow
disks suspended over space, when the yellow ones are
illusionary and the green ones safe … this sort of thing.
Use your vehicle properly. Vehicles might have
unpredictable controls, odd defenses, strange
capabilities that must be discovered (“We jump when
we hit the red button!”), etc. Vehicles might be very
odd ones, or standard ones like rowing boats or riding
a buffalo.
Teleportation or chutes - or alternatively a form of
imprisonment - that will temporarily separate the
party; probably until they are re-united when the
“survivors” complete the trick. If cages come down to
imprison everyone who doesn’t stand in the right place
at the right time, and the release lever is at the far side
of the room, the party risks having everyone trapped
in cages unless they can figure out when and where to
move in order to avoid being caged.
81-90
Move only at the right time. This would follow
a pattern: move only when the light is green, for
example.
Charm or mental domination. Probably this leads to
the affected characters working against the others,
but this doesn’t necessarily mean direct combat. This
category would also include insanity and belief in a
hallucination or illusion.
91-00
Deactivate the risk. If the risk is coming from a
machine with a red button on it, the solution might
be to shoot an arrow that depresses the button and
turns off the machine. Maybe the risk comes from a
bunch of statues which can be de-animated by pulling
a rope located somewhere. Possibilities are endless.
Loss of equipment or possessions. This can be done
in many ways: as wagers, by rusting metal, by statues
grabbing things away, etc.

GAME BOARD PATHWAYS
The “Mode of Forward Movement” table is highly abstract. At first glance it appears that the players are being moved
through a game board such as Chutes & Ladders, Candyland, or Monopoly. However, a true gameboard is only one possibility
for a “Game Board Pathway” trick. The “squares” can be different rooms, different tiers of a pyramid, different disks, the changing possibility for what’s on the other side of a dimensional door, etc.
