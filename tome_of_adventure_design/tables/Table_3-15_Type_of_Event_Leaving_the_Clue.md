Table 3-15: Type of Event Leaving the Clue
Die Roll
01-10

Agreement or treaty: the obvious evidence of a treaty or agreement is the document itself, if it was the sort of
agreement one writes down. Other written evidence can be a letter in which the agreement is mentioned or is
obvious.
11-20
Battle: battles and combats are usually evidenced by the presence of broken arrows, possibly bloodstains, and in
some cases the evidence of spell casting.
21-30
Betrayal: visual evidence of a betrayal is a bit hard to manage, unless a mirror or some other magical device
recorded the event for posterity. A letter is one way of accomplishing this kind of clue, or (depending on the
adventure) the clue might be something like an opened entryway that was supposed to keep enemies out.
31-40
Cave-in: either the area is completely blocked, or it has been cleaned out and a lot of rock is missing. Note
that wooden structures can also collapse. Why did the area cave in, what might it hide, and who is responsible?
Does it indicate that the ceiling above the party’s heads is unstable; does it indicate that the enemies around
the corner have rigged explosives, or does it mean that earth elementals are rampaging in the area? Add some
details, and you have a good clue.
41-50
Execution: there’s a dead body, or a stake with scorch marks around it, or a skeleton hanging from a noose, or
some other sign that an execution took place. Why did it happen? That’s not necessarily part of this clue, but if
it’s just a random piece of “dungeon dressing,” then you’ve missed a good chance to convey information to the
players for future use (or further knowledge about the location and events there).

51-60
Fire: why was there a fire? An execution, arson, evidence of a fire-using monster? Does it reveal the location of
a trap, does it show that combustibles were stored here, or does it reveal something else?
61-70
Flooding: an area is full of water, or there are signs that it once was. This could include a waterline stain,
seashells in a dry area, fish bones, or other such evidence. Why was the area underwater? To kill people? To
store water for drinking, experiments, or fire fighting? Perhaps there is a secret door at the waterline used for
access to the sea or an underground lake. Possibly an aquatic monster once lived here. Possibly the ceiling is
about to open and flood the chamber while the adventurers are looking around.
71-80
Functioning of a trap: this is also covered in evidence of mechanism or use. Here, instead of the sort of
markings left by a mechanical device, we’re probably talking dead bodies.
81-90
Imprisonment: evidence of imprisonment could include a skeleton chained to a wall or in a cell; it could include
written records of a jailer, and it could include scratches left on the wall by a prisoner. These are just a few of
the more obvious examples.
91-00
Lovers’ tryst: evidence of a lover’s tryst might be quite blatant; such as a love letter, or a rumpled and recently
vacated bed; or it might be relatively subtle, with clues such as a coded love letter, or the smell of a distinctive
perfume somewhere it isn’t supposed to be. The identities of the lovers might not be apparent until this clue is
connected with another clue.
