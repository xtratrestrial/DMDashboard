poral Sanctum of the Insatiable Knight.” These are good starting points for the development of an adventure; enough, at least,
to start putting your mind into gear. You might end up with a location that’s completely different from your initial starting point
once all the pieces have fallen into place, been arranged, and been polished. But that’s the nature of the creative process. Getting
it started is often the hardest step.
APPROACH #2: PURPOSE APPROACH
Table 1-2 below is not used in conjunction with Table 1-1A or 1-1B; it is an alterna-

tive approach to generating seeds for an adventure location. The table is focused more
on the purpose of the location than upon its past or present occupants. This table requires
much more creative thinking than Table 1-1A or 1-1B, because many results will be
quite bizarre at first glance. This is deliberate; without strange conjunctions, tables
don’t yield creative results.
