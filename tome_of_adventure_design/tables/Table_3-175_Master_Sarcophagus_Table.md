Table 3-175: Master Sarcophagus Table
Die Roll

A test of
intelligence
Theoretically
impossible, but
workable
The Plot Twists
The spoils of war
Workersâ€™
scaffolding
The symbols are
mirror images of
each other
Eats a horrid food
Thunder
Spatial changer
What was
delivered
Crossbow
Call of the wild
A crisis of magic
Writing on the
wall
Large talons
Unusually cold
```
