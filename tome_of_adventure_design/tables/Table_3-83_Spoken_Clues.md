An actual living
being is present.
Somehow.
This includes
everything from
a talking animal,
to a person, to a
demon.
It either died
here or is trapped
here, and if the
characters solve
the trick it will be
released
It only gives one clue,
and then taunts. The
taunts may be helpful,
since they only come
when the characters
are doing something
wrong (or when they are
indecisive)
It is a construction
or remnant of
something that
really hates (or
hated) the person
who constructed
the trick.
Progressive hints. The
voice offers an ongoing
commentary to give the
players a status report.
For example, it might
say, “Cold,” “warm,”
or “hot” as characters
get closer to (or farther
from) the solution. If the
players are negotiating
with a personality,
the personality might
get very pissed off at
the talking clue. The
personality and the
talking clue might be
long-time enemies, two
facets of a being with
multiple personalities,
etc.
Makes itself known
to the party, answers
one question, and
then falls silent or
disappears.
Makes itself known to
the party before the trick,
and then answers limited
questions about what
they will be facing. It
does not help once the
trick “begins.”
Speaks once,
during the trick
itself, delivering a
rhymed couplet, a
limerick, or a haiku.
Basically, it’s a preprogrammed hint
if the characters
are pursuing a
predictable course
of failure, if they
are inactive, or if
they need to know
that they have now
succeeded.

at the end of the
trick, depending on
whether the party
Eerie or
spooky
Speaks riddles, poetry
or vague instructions
each time the players
complete some part
of the trick, basically
introducing them to the
next part. Alternatively,
it says something at
the end of each part
to let the players know
something has been
completed.
A threat, challenge,
and/or taunting
before the trick
begins. General
taunting. This will
certainly indicate
that something is
about to happen,
or that there is a
challenge available,
although it might
not convey anything
else except attitude.
Jovial

then answers limited
questions while they

a game of twenty
questions, or it might
only have a limited set
of answers.
