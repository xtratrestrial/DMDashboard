Table 2-16: Individual Dragon’s Mentalities, Motivations, and Status
Die Roll

Mentality, Motivation, or Status
01-05
Arcane. Whether or not the dragon is a good spell caster, it knows a great deal of useful arcane lore it has
accumulated over the years. It might even have human magic-user followers, who seek to gain the bits of
knowledge it occasionally provides to them.
06-10
Assembling Followers. Followers, for this purpose, include a set of young or baby dragons, or a group of
fanatical worshippers, or an army of mercenaries, or even something stranger like a collection of trained slimes
or a trained pack of giant lizards.
11-15
Collector. The dragon hoards a particular type of item. Some of these might be relatively innocuous, such as
musical instruments. On the other hand, a dragon who collects human skulls is possibly a big problem.
16-20
Connoisseur. The dragon constantly seeks a supply of something with a particular taste or quality. This
might range from captives to fine wines.

21-25
Constrained to Action. The dragon is forced, either through its nature or due to magic, to respond in certain
ways to certain stimuli. Examples of this include: not being able to tell a lie, required to grant a wish if defeated
in combat, required to hunt down a particular individual, required to guard a certain object, etc.
26-30
Damsel-Kidnapper. Pretty standard.
31-35
Demonic. As with many Christian dragon-stories of the middle ages, the dragon is actually the servant of a
supernatural evil power rather than just a preternatural creature. Dragons that are a form of demon might have
a demonic master nearby, or one that can be summoned. Alternatively, the dragon might be able to summon
lesser demons of some kind into its service. This sort of dragon would be considerably more sinister than a
regular dragon, but not necessarily much more intelligent.
36-40
Vassal. The dragon is subservient to, enchanted by, subdued by, or sworn to another being. For a folkloric
type of dragon, it might be in love with a human maiden or controlled by some other creature weaker than the
dragon itself. Not likely, though.
41-45
Envoy or Scout. The dragon is exploring or negotiating on behalf of some other villain elsewhere. The
questions to be resolved are: (1) on whose behalf is the dragon negotiating, and (2) with whom is the dragon
negotiating, monsters or humans?
46-50
Foreigner. The dragon comes from a different place, either because it has a nomadic personality or because it
was chased out. It is likely working on establishing a new lair.
51-55
Hide. The dragon is virtually obsessed with keeping itself hidden from human notice (or perhaps from the
notice of a stronger dragon, or other enemy or threat). This might be due to caution, might be a younger
dragon’s strategy for getting older and bigger, or might just be due to cowardice.
56-60
Imprisoned. The dragon is in some way confined to an area, either because the exit isn’t large enough, or
because it is scared to leave, or because it is under a mental or magical compulsion, etc.
61-65
Infamy (reputation). The dragon seeks to be well known as a threat, but unlike the knight-killer it approaches
the project in an intelligent and possibly even devious manner.
66-70
Intense Greed. This dragon is even greedier than most, being easily bribed and unable to resist theft.
71-75
Kill Knights (reputation). The dragon seeks to be well known as a threat. Note that for survival reasons, this is
already a fairly dim bulb of a dragon, since the famous ones don’t live long. Being relatively stupid, this dragon
is focused upon killing powerful humans, and it defines “powerful” basically as those who wear heavy armor.
This is the best explanation I can invent for the classic stereotype.
76-80
Land-Destroyer. At whatever speed possible, the dragon seeks to turn the area around its lair into a
wasteland. It spends time fouling water, destroying trees and crops, and killing wildlife.
81-85
Political Power. The dragon seeks to have human minions and influence over civilized areas, rather than
eating (too many) humans or destroying crops. This dragon might even protect its serfs in time of danger.
86-90
Secrets and Wisdom. The dragon knows a great deal of useful information; maps of a dungeon area, legends
about magic items, and other such useful tidbits can be gained from talking to this dragon rather than killing it.
Of course, conversation might not be possible unless the dragon is suitably terrified.
91-95
Vendetta. Some event in the dragon’s past has caused it to swear vengeance against a group, species, or
religion. This could be virtually anything ranging from a wide category like “magic-users,” to a single individual,
to a specific village, to members of a particular order of knights.
96-00
Wounded or Crippled. The dragon might be blind or missing a limb from a past accident or battle. If the
dragon didn’t win that combat, it is likely consumed with a desire for vengeance.

ELEMENTALS
Elementals are creatures associated with a fundamental “element” of nature. These elements, as theorized by European
alchemists, were fire, water, earth, and air. The first explicit use of the elemental creature concept is in Michael Moorcock’s Elric
stories, in which Elric summons the lord of the Earth elementals and the lord of the Water elementals. The idea that elemental
creatures are hierarchical comes from these stories, and fantasy gaming further developed the idea of elemental social strata
by drafting djinn and efreet into the role of nobles. Not only are genies closely associated with fire and air, but Arabian folklore
also ascribed to them the same kind of bargaining and binding that characterized Moorcock’s elementals in the Elric stories.
These tables reflect the concept that there is an entire sub-world of creatures associated
with each element of nature, living in some “other” place but capable of being
summoned into normal reality – or perhaps sneaking in from time to time.
The creatures of these sub-worlds (presumably treated as a separate plane

of existence) are organized into social strata, and can be bound to service
in various ways.
