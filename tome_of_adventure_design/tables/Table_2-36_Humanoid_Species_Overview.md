necessarily, a mastermind type)

Minor special attack (all creatures in
species) *** See Tables 2-70 and 2-71
for ideas.
Willing mercenaries, serving other species and possibly with some
degree of assimilation into the different cultures of their employers

Morphological Changes and Phases
Table 2-84)
Mastermind species (see Tables 2-38 and 2-39 below)*****
71-80
Minor Special Defense (all creatures in
the species). See Table 2-82 for ideas.
Captive-Takers (captives might be from another humanoid species or
monster type rather than humans)
81-90
Contains a sub-type which is larger
than the norm, and is either more
or less intelligent than the normal
members of the species. The sub-type
might be sterile, or might be capable of
interbreeding with the normal members
of the species.
Most relations are trade-oriented, but the species may have strange
approaches to trade (violence, rituals, or honor might factor in, for
example). Trading with the creatures might be a dangerous venture.
91-00
Unusual leader-type or Unusual Ability
in all members of the species**** (50%
chance each)
Generally assist other races and act in coordination with them,
provided that the other species is working toward goals that agree
with those of the species (or of the leader-types). This would be a
species that works from long-range plans, possibly (but definitely not
necessarily) a mastermind species.

*Alliance with related beast-type. Examples might include a species of crab-men that command or live with giant crabs, a
species of wolf-like creatures that live with wolves, etc. In general, the animal alliance will be with the same creature whose
A binding of
spirits
attributes are shared with the humanoid species.
**Interesting Weapon. The species manufactures and/or uses some weapon that other species can’t use well. A species of fourarmed warriors might use a very heavy flail using all four hands, as a very simple example. The key here, though, is that the
weapon should have some effect that makes tactical combat interesting. The weapon might have a chance to disarm, poison,
cause disease, immobilize, hamper, or weaken opponents, or might just deal greater-than-normal damage in the hands of one
of the members of the humanoid species.

Machine

*** Minor special attacks will also, generally, be related to the underlying animal type that has been mixed with human attributes
to create the humanoid species. Crab-men might have pincers, for example, or the ability to drag opponents under the water.
**** Unusual Abilities will be related to the underlying animal type. Crab-men would be able to breathe under water.
***** Even though Mastermind Species is listed as a relationship to other species, that doesn’t necessarily give the broadest picture – rolling a second time on Column 2 might get you an interesting picture of how a mastermind species functions.

This table makes lots of references to the “underlying creature,” meaning one of the animal types used to generate the humanoid species on Table 2-2. If you didn’t use Table 2-2, just pick whatever animal the humanoid species is most similar to.
