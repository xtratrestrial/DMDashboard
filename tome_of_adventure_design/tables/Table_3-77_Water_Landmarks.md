THE “WHAT COMES NEXT” METHOD
Sometimes you just want some creative ideas for what comes next in a dungeon you’re already designing, and you don’t want
to get deep into a whole system for designing a dungeon from the top down. The following table is easier to use when the problem is just a bit of creative block happening mid-stride. It points you back to the above tables, but gives you a specific place to
start instead of just paging around for an idea.
