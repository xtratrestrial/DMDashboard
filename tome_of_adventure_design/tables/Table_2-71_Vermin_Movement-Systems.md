Table 2-71: Vermin Movement-Systems
Die Roll

Mode of Movement
01-20
Delivery and Retrieval. Some mechanism or process in the adventure area delivers the vermin to a location
and then retrieves them (or lets them die). This is an analogy to the use of “scrubbing bubbles,” or nanotechnology. It doesn’t need to be high-tech or even well explained. Perhaps a chute simply delivers green slime
or rats to a particular location, and then spouts corrosive gas into the area when the vermin are assumed to have
eaten whatever needs to be eaten. Or perhaps a big suction-hose gathers them up after a period of time.
21-40
Dimensional movement or lairs. Whether or not the vermin have any dimensional powers that manifest
in combat, they live and/or move about through some other dimension (not another plane of existence – just
another dimension). This might be a feature of the vermin themselves, or it might be an odd feature of the
adventure area.
41-60
Requires a certain
image
Biting mandibles
Elemental association. The vermin move through an elemental plane of some kind. In this case, they
are probably elemental creatures of some kind, or a hybrid of “pure” elemental matter and normal “mixed”
material.
61-80
Through tunnels burrowed in the walls, ceiling, or floors. The standard, in other words.
81-00
Vermin infest moving monsters. Perhaps the vermin are parasites, or perhaps their larvae are dropped
from the movement of some other kind of monster (a golem?). This would keep the vermin population moving
around.

PART TWO:
GENERAL MONSTER TABLES
OVERALL COMBAT PROFILE
This table generates an overall combat profile for a monster, regardless of type. The first column addresses the monster’s
attack profile by identifying the body parts used for physical attacks (each body type leading to a specific subtable), and the
number of special attacks the monster uses (generated on Special Attack subtables). The second column (which contains only a
small number of actual entries) sets the number of special defenses the monster uses. In addition to special defenses, the second
column sets the monster’s number of Distinctive Attributes. Distinctive Attributes can be skipped in favor of moving on to the
specific monster types after generating a combat profile.
