RESULT OF TRIGGERING ACTION
The distinction between a “trick” and a “trap” (at least for the purpose of these

tables) is that a trick can confer a benefit if treated properly. Therefore, if the only
puzzle or matter of player skill involved is to get the trick to activate, the result will be
a benefit. However, many Magic Thing tricks are more complex – triggering them is
only the first step, and the test of player skill begins once the trick is activated.
