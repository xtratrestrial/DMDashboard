THE MOTIVATIONAL ELEMENT: “SELLING” THE ADVENTURE
TO THE PARTY
Another very important factor in all adventures is making the players want to undertake the adventure. Unless you want
your campaign to be an endless series of situations in which the characters are forced into adventure after adventure dint of
blackmail, high-handed kings, and other “railroading” devices, you will need to entice the players into choosing the “prepared”
adventure of their own free will. Good refereeing is a matter of letting the players choose their courses of action, but that
doesn’t mean you can’t dangle the carrot in front of them to nudge them toward the adventures you’ve planned. Your adventures should be posed as opportunities, not necessities. Of course, every rule is made to be broken from time to time, but in
general you should think about two things: (1) the players should see – and you have to communicate – the opportunity for a
dramatic, interesting good time, and (2) you should play to the ever-present player motivations of experience and gold, which are
the underlying forces of motivation embodied in the game rules; or to the desire for fame or moral achievement, which might or
might not be important factors to your individual players. Make sure that the players can see and perceive the adventure as an
opportunity to gain fame, fortune, and buckets of gold for their characters. They’ll take the bait every time.
