Damage from activity: failed saving throw means the character takes a certain number of hit points damage per
hour, but physical exertion (moving, fighting, spell casting) causes additional damage per combat round.
45-46
hour, but physical exertion (moving, fighting, spell casting) requires an additional saving throw to avoid instant
death.
47-48
Damage from spell casting: failed saving throw means the character takes a certain number of hit points damage
per hour (eventually lethal, but very slow), but also takes hit point damage whenever he casts a spell (probably
dependent on the power of the spell). None of the damage caused by spell casting can be healed unless the
poison is removed from the system.
49-50
Experience Point Erosion (lethal): failed saving throw means that character loses a particular number of
experience points every hour until reaching 0 (death). The more lethal the poison, the higher the number of
experience points lost each hour. Experience point loss is permanent unless restored.

experience points lost each hour. Experience points return (at some rate) if the poison is neutralized.
53-54
Internal damage (ability score based): if the victim fails a saving throw, he suffers internal damage and must
make a “check” against his constitution score every time he suffers damage from another source. Failing the
check (rolling higher than the ability score on a d20) indicates that the damage caused by the poison causes
death (from a weakened artery, stomach lining, etc).
55-56
Internal damage (increasing): if the victim fails a saving throw, he suffers internal damage and has a 10% chance
of dying when he next takes damage from a wound, spell, fall, or other source of hit point damage. The next
wound has a 15% chance of killing him, the next wound a 20% chance, and so on. (A stronger poison might
have a higher initial chance of death or cumulate at more than 5% per wounding).
57-58
Internal damage (lethal): if the victim fails a saving throw, he suffers internal damage and has a 10% chance of
dying each time he takes damage from a wound, spell, fall, or other source of hit point damage. (A stronger
poison might have a higher chance of death).
59-60
61-62
Internal damage (saving throw/level based - progressive): if the victim fails a saving throw, he suffers internal
damage and must make a saving throw every time he suffers damage from another source. Failing the saving
throw indicates that the damage caused by the poison causes death (from a weakened artery, stomach lining,
etc). Each saving throw has a cumulative –1 penalty.

63-64
Lethal (don’t eat): failed saving throw means the character has a 25% chance of dying every time he eats
65-66
Lethal (don’t eat): failed saving throw means the character will die the next time he eats food
67-68
Lethal (don’t sleep): failed saving throw means the character has a 25% chance of dying whenever he sleeps
unless the poison is reversed.
69-70
Lethal (don’t sleep): failed saving throw means the character will succumb to the poison and die when he next
sleeps.
71-72
Lethal (stay out of the sun): failed saving throw means the character takes damage from sunlight (some number
of points per hour’s exposure) and those hit points cannot be healed unless the poison itself is removed from the
system.
73-74
Lethal, delayed by level: failed saving throw means that the character will die in a number of combat rounds
equal to his level.
75-76
Lethal, delayed by level: failed saving throw means that the character will die in a number of hours equal to his
level.
77-78
Lethal, delayed: failed saving throw means death in a certain number of combat rounds

Level Erosion (lethal): failed saving throw means that the character loses a level and continues to lose more levels
(perhaps one per day) until reaching 0 (death). Level loss is permanent unless the levels are restored. Note:
levels tend to be associated with life force, so this sort of poison would likely be associated with the undead,
planes of shadow, or other such supernatural forces. Mere loss of memory would be better addressed with a
poison that erodes experience points rather than experience levels

(perhaps one per day) until reaching 0 (death). Levels are regained (at some rate) if the poison is neutralized.
93-94
Percentile chance of death (eroding): Each hour, the victim has a percentage chance of dying instantly (the
percentile chance corresponding to the strength of the poison). The percentile chance increases each hour.
Example: if the victim fails a saving throw, he has a 10% chance of dying immediately; if he survives, he must
make a check every subsequent hour, with the first check at 15%, the second check at 20%, etc.
95-96
Percentile chance of death: Each hour, the victim has a percentage chance of dying instantly (the percentile
chance corresponding to the strength of the poison).
97-98
Saving throw checks (eroding): a failed saving throw means the character starts the process of dying, but can
stave it off for a while – each hour, the character must make a saving throw or die instantly. Also, each hour, a
cumulative –1 penalty is added to that die roll.
99-00
Saving throw checks: a failed saving throw means the character starts the process of dying, but can stave it off for
a while – each hour, the character must make a saving throw or die instantly.

POISON EFFECTS (NON-LETHAL)
Note that “mental” effects of poisons are short term – that would indicate insanity, which is much more linked with magic
than poisons are – a “poison” is something that works non-magically. Magical poisons should be thought of as potions, and

poison would indicate a poison of quasi-mythical potency and will understandably tick off your players).
