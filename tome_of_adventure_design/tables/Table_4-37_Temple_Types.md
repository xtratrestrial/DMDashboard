Holy Ground Only: A piece of land (possibly extremely small) is known for an event that happened there (possibly it actually did, possibly it is only local legend). People gather there for festivals or on certain dates unless the place is isolated or in the

Shrine: A shrine is a man-made place of worship that has no buildings or dedicated priesthood (although priests might stop
by, or maintain the shrine from some other location). The shrine is likely a statue of some kind, although there might be a small
structure build to protect whatever constitutes the shrine. A shrine has a 25% chance to be built on Holy Ground (see table
below), but it would not have a natural feature in addition to the shrine.
Chapel: A chapel is a building (or room) for small worship services. In some cases (50%) the chapel will have a full-time
priest in attendance. If not, a priest from some other location comes to officiate at services. A historical example of chapels

comes from the middle ages, when noble families would often have private chapels in their castles or manor houses, with the
parish priest coming to hold private services for the noble family. However, it is quite possible for chapels to be completely separate from other buildings (which is the assumption here). If there is a full-time priest at the chapel, there is a 20% chance that
the chapel has an Administrative Function in addition to its purely religious function â€“ see the tables below to determine what
that function is. Any chapel, whether there is a full-time priest or not, has a 30% chance to be built on Holy Ground, and a 10%
chance to house a relic (see table).

Small Temple: A small temple is a Temple Structure containing quarters for priests and a worship area. The temple will
have 1d2 priests and 1d4 acolytes. It has a 40% chance to be built on Holy Ground, a 30% chance to house a relic (see table),
and a 30% chance to have an Administrative Function.
Large Temple: A large temple is a Temple Structure containing quarters for 1d4+1 priests, 1d4+1 acolytes. It has a 60%
chance to be built on Holy Ground, a 60% chance to house a relic, and will have 1d2 Administrative Functions.
