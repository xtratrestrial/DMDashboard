Move back two “squares,” or other type of
backtracking. This could be done with chutes,
teleportation, or any other traditional dungeon
element that moves people around. Alternatively, it

to the internal logic of the game board. “Your pirate
ship is caught in a storm – move back one square.”
Or “move back 1d6 squares.” Whatever makes sense
inside the game.
Get to see what happens in some of the future squares

There is no risk. That’s the reward.

Move forward two squares (or otherwise get an extra
move)
