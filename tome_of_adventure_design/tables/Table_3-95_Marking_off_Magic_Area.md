MAGIC THING TRICKS
Interacting with magical things is one of the staples of a dungeon adventure, and it is a broad topic, since neither the word
“magic” nor the word “thing” does much to narrow down the category.
Magic Thing tricks are composed of four basic elements:
• A Warning (possibly): Table 3-96
• A Central Feature: Table 3-97
• A Triggering Action: Table 3-99
• Result of Triggering the Trick: Table 3-100
