G. EVOKE CATASTROPHIC EVENT
Evoking catastrophic events is a common theme for villains. Generally adventures focused on this sort of villain will involve
discovery of the plot and an attempt to prevent the catastrophe. Since in most cases the catastrophe hasn’t yet taken place, the
table focuses mainly on the missing element the villain hasn’t yet completed. In some cases, the nature of the villain’s plot might
not be known ahead of time – in other words, the party might discover the villain’s plot after attacking his stronghold for a different reason (treasure, usually).
