Table 3-140: Trap Kill-Mechanisms
Die Roll

Progressive Gas Effect (while
exposed) (d100)
Slow-Moving Mechanical
(d100)
Repeated Attacks
01-10
Periodical unavoidable loss of hit
points (a set number, probably low)
Closing walls or other means
of shrinking the enclosure until
everyone is crushed. Includes slowly
advancing steamrollers, etc.
Missile traps fire periodically
into area
11-20
21-30
31-40
41-50
Rocks or heavy objects fall
periodically into area
Area fills with something that causes
slight but progressively increasing
damage (e.g., biting bugs or very
weak poison gas)
Monsters are periodically
released into area
Periodical random drops in experience
(death at 0, effects temporary if
survived)
Cutting or slicing implements move
slowly across area (top to bottom or
side to side)
Swinging arms (or similar,
such as wrecking balls) make
periodical attacks
Periodical unmodified “attribute
checks” (until failure)
Slowly increasing heat or cold
Area-effect spells go off in
the area periodically (very
weak fireballs, for example)
Declining ability score (death at 0),
with decline happening upon failed
attribute check or saving throw
The pathway of a
specific ant
Measure for
Measure
The Unholy Prism
Area slowly fills with water or other
liquid. Note: if the party is separated,
this could also involve lowering them
into something at random rates,
different times, etc. Alternatively,
the floor is quicksand or some other
substance that people sink into.
Periodical unmodified saving throws
(until failure)
Wall hangings
Slipshod
Calming
Capture the item
Waiting for the
invasion
String of beads
Heist
Serpent
Strange accent
A secret network
Part of the
equation is
missing
Misdirection
Six turns of the
gear

Table 3-140: Trap Kill-Mechanisms continued
An attribute of a
flowering plant
Copper serpent
Air is slowly sucked out of the area
Area-effect spells go off, but
only in parts of the area – if
you’re standing in the right
place at that time, you’re
safe.
61-70
Loss of hit points each time a
periodical saving throw fails (a random
or set number of hit points each time)
Area slowly fills with deadly poison
gas that is either heavier or lighter
than air (keep your head high or low,
respectively).
Walls, ceiling, or floor
suddenly contract, rise,
or fall, but only in certain
areas. This might only cause
damage, or might actually be
lethal if you’re in the wrong
place at the wrong time.
71-80
Series of flat percentile chances to die
or be affected by other measurement
such as drop in ability score, hit points,
or experience points down toward
death.
Objects are pushed into room one
at a time. Eventually there won’t
be more room, and anyone inside
will be crushed as more objects are
forced in.
Dangerous liquids (boiling
water, slime, etc) squirt or
pour into certain parts of the
area at random intervals.
81-90
A series of “steps,” each associated
with a greater level of inability to act
(e.g., laughter causing lower ability
to mess with the escape hatch).
Characters move to the next step
based on periodical saving throws,
percentile chances, or ability checks.
An obviously deadly mechanism in
the middle of the area is counting
down until it operates – as shown by
an hourglass or some other way of
communicating the slow building-up
of the threat.
Flames, electricity, or blasts
of frost shoot into random
areas at random intervals
91-00
Periodical loss of hit points, random
number each time
Really dangerous monster (like a
demon) slowly begins to coalesce in
the area
Spears or very long spikes
stick out into the area at
random
Draped with
feathers
A raven is involved
51-60
Periodical saving throws with
cumulative penalty added each time
A mismatched
assembly
Dangerous
methods
Spiders
The top-ranked
competitor
Fluffy little dog
Crocodiles
Plague doctors
Journalist
Efreet
Moon bird
Melts into
nothingness
A fateful ceremony
Crypts
Exiled nobility
Pattern of
movement
Do you want to
know the problem
with that theory?
Tactics: uneven
terrain
A clicking noise
KILL-SWITCHES AND ESCAPE HATCHES
A kill-switch is a way of turning off a trap, either before it springs or once it is already in operation. In slow-killing traps, it
can be a matter of life or death to figure out how the kill-switch operates (or where it is). Escape hatches usually have to be figured out or found as well, but instead of turning off the trap, they allow people to exit before being killed or harmed.
