Wizard’s research
The list below is useful because it gives a picture of the castle as a self-contained community, which (as fortresses) they tend to
be. Even if your campaign isn’t based on the medieval period, and your “castle” is actually a Pagoda or a clay-brick hill fortress
in a Mesopotamian-type region, these same jobs are likely to exist, just with different names.
