A. CONCEALMENT
Used as a creative tool to generate the start of an adventure, this table gives some details about a villain whose highest priority
at the moment is to simply to hide himself (itself) or the evidence of another plan (past, present, or future). Most likely, this is only
the first step in his grand scheme, but it might be a clean-up operation from a different plan that has just finished for good or ill.
The table is primarily for intelligent mastermind-types; if you’ve already got an unintelligent monster in mind, assume that it’s
building a hidden lair of some sort or roll on the Food-Related Activities table.
