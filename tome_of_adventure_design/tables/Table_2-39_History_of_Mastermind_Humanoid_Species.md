01-10
Unevolved form
was conquered and
“improved” by a more
powerful species
Became twisted by a catastrophe
that affected most members of the
race
Generally get along with humankind, except
when humankind pisses them off
Evolved in another
dimension
Some sort of interaction with a god
or other major power changed the
species (or split the species into two
groups)
Consider humans to be nothing more than
slaves or even food
21-30
Evolved on a distant
moon or planet
Needed to escape into another
dimension, world, or environment
(e.g., chased into and adapted to a
subterranean environment)
Became fragmented into small groups and
individuals due to the risk of disease
31-40
Created or bred by a
deity, demigod, or other
major power.
Became powerful and ruled a large
area, but were then decimated by
war, disease, or rebelling slaves
individuals because ego and pride make it
impossible for them to work together. They
hate other members of their own species.
Evolved underground
Ruled by a more powerful species,
which bred them or magically
changed them
Seek revenge or have a particular racial
hatred (not necessarily against humanity – it
might even be a monster type)
Encountered lost knowledge, which
changed them and made them more
powerful and intelligent
Require a particular kind of food, probably
either a rare plant or humans
51-60
Evolved aboveground
Exiled follower
Hourglass
Residual effects
Tactics: an ambush
Evidence of a spell
A chase
Die Roll
41-50
Magical sound
Captain of a river
barge

Unstable magic
Extremely wise
61-70
Evolved in water
Arrived at present location (world,
moon, subterranean realms, etc) via
a migration to avoid a natural or
magical catastrophe in their original
location
Became expert breeders of a monster
type (or new hybrid) that accompanies
most members of the species. If the
physical characteristics of the species were
determined using Table 2-2, the animal
is probably the underlying animal used to
generate the species’ physical characteristics.
71-80
more powerful species
(now extinct) to fulfill
a specific function
in the society of that
species – food, laborers,
accountants, spellcasters, etc.
Developed a caste structure with
different abilities for the different
castes (this can include entering into
corporeal bodies of different types)
Reproductive competition separates the
males or females from each other. One
gender is polygamous or polyandrous, and
the other gender is probably smaller, weaker,
and/or less intelligent.
81-90
Began as a species
of incorporeal spiritbeings, gaining bodies
as a result of the events
in the second stage (next
column)
Rebellion within the society
caused a split within the species (a
multiple caste structure, division
into powerful leaders and lesser
followers, or two hostile sub- species)
Entire species is now subject to a Time
Cycle (Table 1-29), although not all
members of the species are necessarily
subject to the same influences at the same
times – they may be out of synch with
each other. This would be due to events in
columns 1 or 2, but it has become more or
less pronounced than earlier.
91-00
Evolved as flying
creatures, but unless
you want them to retain
flight, they lose their
flying capabilities during
the Second Stage (next
Extinction of a more powerful
species allowed this species to grab
power and magic, which led to
higher intelligence
Each member of the species accumulates
knowledge or unusual items that make each
individual member of the species relatively
unique in its capabilities.

MIST CREATURES
Mist creatures are normally unintelligent, acting on instinct. They can normally be damaged in only a few ways, and often
function in the nature of a localized hazard. The table below offers two other suggestions: mist-monsters created by a machine,
and mist-monsters created by another monster-type. In addition to being a naturally-occurring phenomenon, they might also be
created by divine (or demonic) vengeance, by the prayers or invocations of a large number of people, by a dimensional rift, or by
