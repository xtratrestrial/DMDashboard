Precious Stone
(d100)

Notes (Do not roll dice)
01-02
Agate
A form of chalcedony. When cut, agates often show beautiful banding and stripes; these
are called striped agate. Agate can also be the mineral which forms a fossil.
03-04
Agate Geode
Rock nodules containing agate inside. These can be dramatic when cut open, but since
they make a bowl shape when cut, and have unremarkable rock on the outside, they
would not ordinarily be used as personal jewelry.
Die Roll
05-06
Fossilized tree resin. Amber can come in many colors, usually with a yellowish cast.
Blue amber exists, and is the rarest form. Amber occasionally contains insects that were
trapped in the resin and fossilized along with it.

Amethyst (Purple)
A variety of quartz. It can be carved, and since it was believed by the Romans to
prevent drunkenness, they carved it into cups.
09-10
Amethyst (Yellow)
A yellow form of amethyst.
11-12
Apatite
Green and blue colored apatite are used as gemstones. The stone can occasionally be
chatoyant (i.e., a cat’s-eye appearance).
13-14
Aquamarine
A blue form of beryl.
15-16
Beryl
Pure beryl is transparent; when it contains impurities, these give it color. Colored forms
of beryl have other names – emeralds and aquamarine are both forms of beryl.
17-18
Bloodstone
A dark green chalcedony flecked with spots of red jasper. It is also often called
Heliotrope.
Highly artistic
19-20
Carnelian
A red form of chalcedony.
Wreathed in

21-22
Chalcedony
A somewhat translucent gemstone with a waxy-looking surface. Several other gemstones
are forms of chalcedony.
Unshielded
23-24
Chrysoprase
Green chalcedony
25-26
Coral
Coral can be carved and polished to create a wide variety of shapes and figures. The
range of colors covers the entire spectrum.

Caltrops in the
street
27-28
Diamond
Most diamonds are clear, but impurities can result in diamonds of almost any color –
these are rarer than clear diamonds.
29-30
Diamond (Black)
Black diamonds don’t exist in the real world, so they are fabulously rare in fantasy
worlds
31-32
Diamond (Blue)
Blue diamonds. These result from boron impurities, but the important thing is that they
are rarer (more valuable) than normal diamonds.
Cloves
33-34
Emerald
The green form of beryl. Emeralds are rare and valuable.
The peril of a
reflection
35-36
Feldspar
A very common mineral, but some forms of it are lustrous and attractive. Moonstone is
a form of feldspar, and virtually all valuable feldspar would be a form of moonstone.
37-38
Garnet
A fairly common mineral, but some forms of it are rarer and interesting. Some forms of
garnet change color depending on the light; for example, one type changes from a bluegreen all the way to purple. Garnets come in a variety of colors; red, yellow, brown, etc.
There is a blue type, which is the rarest.
39-40
Golden Beryl
A golden yellow form of beryl, often called Heliodore.
A long-sought
treaty
41-42
Hematite
Hematite is a metal, a form of iron oxide, which varies from steel-colored to black,
to red. Powdered hematite dust can be fatal if inhaled, and was used as a trap in an
ancient Egyptian tomb.
Alcoves
43-44
Ivory
Ivory comes from tusks, and can be carved and polished.
Fronds
45-46
Jade (Black)
Doesn’t actually exist, so very valuable in a fantasy world.
Ancient dragon
47-48
Jade (Blue)
A blue form of jade.
Sabotage
49-50
Jade (Green)
The most valuable form of jade (with the exception of black jade, which doesn’t exist in
the real world).
51-52
Jasper
Opaque chalcedony that has been polished. Colors range around red, yellow, brown
and green, but there is also a rarer blue type.
A strange noise
53-54
Lapis Lazuli
A blue, relatively rare semi-precious stone. A lot of lapis was used in the jewelry found
in Tutankhamen’s tomb.
Peasant Rebellion
55-56
Malachite
A vibrant green, relatively common stone.
Deceptive
appearance
57-58
Moonstone
A form of feldspar which looks pearl-like and reflects light, vaguely, from inside the
stone.
59-60
Moss Agate
Agate that contains filament-like patterns of other minerals. These look like plant
material, giving the stone the “moss” name.
61-62
Mother of Pearl
Pearl-like deposits, very common. The value of a piece of mother-of-pearl would
depend almost entirely upon the quality with which it was carved, not the value of the
mother-of-pearl itself. However, a really big piece would have to have come from a giant
clam or oyster (rarer), and weirdly shaped fantasy mollusks could also create weirdlyshaped pieces of mother-of-pearl, and these would also be relatively rare.
63-64
Obsidian
Volcanic glass. Obsidian is dark colored, and can be used to make very sharp edges.
65-66
Onyx
A form of banded quartz.
67-68
Opal
Opal ranges widely in color, although the red and black ones are rare. Opals have lots
of internal colors all together, which is very unusual.

69-70
Opal (Black)
Black opals are the rarest kind of opal. They still have other colors within the stone, the
rarest combination being black and red.
71-72
Opal (Fire)
Fire opal would be the reverse of a black opal, predominantly red with internal black
colorations.
73-74
Pearl
Formed in oysters. They can have a wide range of rarity based on color and shape.
Sea pearls are also rarer than freshwater ones. Mollusks other than oysters can produce
pearls, and some of these can be quite valuable.
75-76
Pearl (Black)
Black pearls are very rare; they do exist in the real world.
77-78
Pearl (Purple)
A rare color of sea pearl
79-80
Peridot
An olive-green gemstone that only occurs in this one color. They can easily be mistaken
for emeralds. Interestingly, peridot has been found in meteorites.
81-82
Quartz (Rose)
A particular color of quartz.
Barricade of
Insanity
83-84
Quartz (Smoky)
A particular color of quartz
Djinni
85-86
Ruby
Ruby, emerald, sapphire, and diamond are the four true precious stones. Rubies are the
same mineral as sapphires, but they are the ones running from pink to dark red.
87-88
Sapphire
One of the four true precious stones, sapphires are a form of corundum which can be
any color other than pink or red (which are considered rubies).
89-90
Sapphire (White)
There is no such thing as a white sapphire, so these would be much more valuable than
ordinary sapphires, which are already quite valuable.
91-92
Tiger’s Eye
A form of quartz that is “chatoyant,” meaning that it looks like there is an eye.
93-94
Topaz (any)
Pure topaz is colorless
95-96
Topaz (blue)
Blue topaz is the rarest color of topaz
97-98
Tourmaline
A semi-precious stone that can be found in almost any color, including colorless.
Turquoise (various
colors)
Lower-quality turquoise is fairly common, but higher quality specimens can be very
valuable indeed. Egypt and Persia were the first major sources of turquoise. The stone
can be blue, green or red, and often has veins of color running through it.
