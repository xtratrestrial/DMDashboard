In the case of mastermind species, adding some sort of background in addition to the themes of Table 2-38 may help to
define how the members of the species think. Use the table below to generate a sequential history of the species. There is a 50%
chance that the species became masterminds during the first stage, and (if they didn’t) a 50% chance in the second stage and a
100% chance in the third stage. Once this thought-exercise is finished, and has given you ideas about the mastermind species,
feel free to discard the details of the history – a history isn’t needed at all to have a good monster species.
