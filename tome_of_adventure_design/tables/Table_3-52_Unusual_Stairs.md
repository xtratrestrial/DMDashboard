Unusual Aspect of Stairs (d100)
Stairwell changes position to lead to different locations (either depth or different locations on a particular level)
based on pattern of steps taken by first person descending/ascending the stairs. Example: normal step-stepstep leads to location 1, but two steps down and one step back causes the stairs to lead to an entirely different
location.
