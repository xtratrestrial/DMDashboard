A large monster has taken the ruin as a lair, since it offers convenient shelter for sleeping (and perhaps breeding).
31-40
Adopted as holy site and temple for a sect that needs to remain secret or in the wilderness
41-50
An adventuring party has taken possession of the ruins in order to search for treasure. Possibly there is a
dungeon entrance, possibly the ruins are complex enough that searching is required even on the surface.
51-60
Assassins, thieves, or some other stealthy group (possibly including rangers, smugglers, bootleggers, drug dealers,
counterfeiters, or druids) have taken up residence in the ruins.
61-70
Headquarters and hideout for a military group (that has not started operations yet)
71-80
Headquarters and hideout for raiding group
81-90
Infested with giant beetles, wasps, and/or other large vermin as a convenient nest with shady places.
91-00
Whoever or whatever caused the ruination of the site is still present, picking over the remains and possibly
covering their tracks. Perhaps they are raising the original inhabitants as undead creatures.
