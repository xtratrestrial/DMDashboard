Perils and
prophesies
Bomb or grenade-type attack. The
plant hurls big seed-pods, spore-sacs,
or gas-bulbs. They might hit the target
directly or not, but they also have a
burst radius.
Acid (damage for a series of rounds, and stronger acids might
damage equipment)
Exhaled cloud (gas or mist)
Cold. Some sort of chemical reaction in the substance of the
distance attack makes it cause damaging cold. For the life of me, I
can’t figure out how this would fit into a plant’s life cycle, but it’s an
interesting thought, isn’t it?
Exhaled cone (gas or mist)
Confusion. The substance is like a drug, causing victims to move, or
even attack, randomly.

Physical Distance Attack
16-20
Gas or mist (radial release in all
directions)
Disease causing a transformation in the victim. He progressively
turns into a “plant zombie” with seeds attached to him, and starts
traveling around while shedding the seeds (this is how the plant
reproduces).
21-25
Gas or mist: exhaled stream at single
opponent
Disease causing a transformation in the victim: turns into one of
these plant creatures (in a matter of days).
26-30
Horrid, massive, vomit-eruption of
liquid or goo (short range, but hits
anyone in the area)
Disease causing slow but progressive onset of paralysis (not lethal,
but the effects might last for days).
31-35
Hurls, fires, or spits: needles, thorns or
spikes
Disease causing victim to carry spores or seeds. In a matter of days,
he turns into a “bag” of spores or seeds, and explodes or otherwise
dies. This is how the plant spreads its seeds. There should be a
physical sign of the condition so the players know that they need to
get the character cured before he dies.
36-40
Ray (uses eyelike organ, eyestalks, or
other non-eyelike organ)
Disease with slow onset of death (measured in several melee rounds,
not days).
41-45
Smell (directed squirt at a single target)
Double-whammy. The victim gets an uncontrollable hunger to eat
fruit from the plant. Not only does this bring him close to the plant,
where it can attack him, but the fruit does something very unpleasant
as well, if he manages to eat it.
46-50
Smell (in a directed cone)
Hallucinations. These could cause a multitude of effects: fear,
confused and unpredictable actions, attempts to damage oneself, etc.
51-55
Smell (radius)
Heat. Some sort of chemical reaction is intended to cook the plant’s
food. Powerful versions of this might cause metal armor to inflict
damage for more than one combat round.
56-60
Spit (glob or liquid, single target)
Lethal poison with rapid or immediate onset of death.
61-65
Spit (line of liquid, ooze, or sap)
Lethal poison with slow onset (but probably causing immediate and
progressive weakness).
66-70
Spores (cone)
Mental control by plant. The substance delivered by the physical
distance attack allows the victim to perceive mind-waves emanating
from the plant, and he follows its commands. If he makes a saving
throw, he might get the interesting result of hearing the commands
but not feeling compelled to follow them.
71-75
Spores (launches a “bag” that explodes)
Non-lethal poison causing fear (flight or disorganized retreat).
76-80
Spores (line toward single opponent)
Non-lethal poison causing lethargy or slowness of action.

81-85
Spores (radial “burst”)
Non-lethal poison causes mental-type paralysis (renders victim
utterly blissful, causes victim not to care about movement, causes
paralyzing fear, etc).
86-90
Spray (cone of liquid, ooze, or sap)
Non-lethal poison causing physical paralysis.
91-95
Spray (line of liquid, ooze, or sap aimed
at single opponent)
Non-lethal poison causing effective paralysis: e.g., nausea or seizures.
At the drop of
a hat
Blood of the fey
Squirt liquid (single target)
Uncontrolled emotion. The effect of the substance on humans is an
uncontrolled emotion such as berserker rage, incapacitating sorrow,
fits of uncontrolled laughter, or some similar effect.

SAMPLE UNUSUAL REPRODUCTION METHODS FOR PLANTS
In many cases, a plant-monster’s attack method is involved with the plant’s reproductive cycle. In cases where it isn’t, and
when you want to add a bit of weirdness to the plant’s overall nature, this short table offers a couple of unusual modes of plant
reproduction to spark your creativity. Note that the primary reproductive strategy for plants is a matter of making seeds travel as
far as possible from the parent-plant.
