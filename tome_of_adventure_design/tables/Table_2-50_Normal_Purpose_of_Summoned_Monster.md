As one example of how to use these tables, let’s generate a summoned creature.
First, we roll a result of 41 on Table 2-50, and discover that the normal reason for summoning our
creature is to use it as a food harvester. Next, we roll a result of 78 on Table 2-51, learning that the
creature has the head of a beast, a human body, and a tail. We roll a 60 on Table 2-2, which suggests
that our creature has the head of an octopus. One immediate idea coming from these random results is that the creature is used to harvest food underwater, since it has the head of an octopus.
We roll on Table 2-52 to see what it’s made of, and (rolling a 98 on the first column of that table) we
discover that our creature is made of green-flecked stone. And finally, rolling a 29 on Table 2-53, we
find that if the summons is done incorrectly, the summoned creature will be weaker than normal, or
deformed. From somewhere, probably because the thing sounds so much like Cthulhu, I decide that
it is normally summoned by tribesmen (and that’s either to catch some sort of big fish, or dive for
pearls). It sounds silly to have a stone statue swimming underwater, so browsing through the tables
I decide that it’s a fungus, instead of being made of stone.
So now we have a creature that rises from a growth of fungus when summoned, shaping the fungi
into a massive man-shaped thing with the head of an octopus, which harvests pearls at the dead of
night in deep waters. If the summons is not made correctly, the shape rising from the fungi will be
misshapen, and weaker than normal … or perhaps diseased. H.P. Lovecraft would adore it.
PHYSICAL FORM OF SUMMONED CREATURE
Note: This table makes frequent references to Table 2-2, a list of animals and their attributes. Sometimes it’s easier to just
come up with animal types on the fly while using this table, but if you want to get completely random results, I would bookmark
Table 2-2 before starting to roll the dice.
