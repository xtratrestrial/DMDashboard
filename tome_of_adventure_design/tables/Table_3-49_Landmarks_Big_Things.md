LEVEL CHANGES (LANDMARKS)
Don’t create dungeon levels like a computer game, where there’s one way down to the next level and virtually the entire level
needs to be explored to get there. If you’re using the “holistic Dungeon” method, put in about one level change per two “areas.”
Also keep in mind that not all level changes need to be stairs. Some of them can be the equivalent of traps, taking the adventurers completely unawares!
