EXPERIMENT TRICKS
In general, an experiment trick is just the combination of things by the characters, and the results. Sometimes these tricks are
obvious (three bottles and mixing basin, or three levers), and sometimes they are not obvious (they combine themselves). It’s best
to decide that after generating the trick, though.
To generate an experiment trick, roll on the Master Table (Table 3-87) to see what two types of elements are being combined,
and what the general type of result is going to be. Roll for specific results on the appropriate columns of the Table of First Elements (Table 3-88) and the Table of Second Elements (Table 3-89). Then juggle those elements around with the “Result Type”
and see what emerges (the Result Types are explained after the tables).
MASTER TABLE OF EXPERIMENT TRICKS
Note: If your experiment turns out to look like something that might have both a good result and a bad result, roll a second
time on the Result Type column to get the alternate possibility. Sometimes, once you’ve generated the experiment and gotten
one result, the other possibility will be very clear.
