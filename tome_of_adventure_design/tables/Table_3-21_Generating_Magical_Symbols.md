Keep in mind that the capital letters of the alphabet referred to in this table are meant to identify a set of basic line shapes,
not letters. If they resemble letters too much, your rune is going to look too modern and the elements of it will be too obvious.

These are basic starter-shapes, not letters.
Pickled peppers
There are some tricks to help you overcome this difficulty. The first trick is to alter the “normal” line lengths involved in
drawing a capital letter of the alphabet – i.e., the proportions of the letter. The second trick is to draw the capital letter partly
using straight lines and partly using curved lines. The third trick is to vary line widths in the rune, making some lines thicker than
others. This third trick generates more artistic and magical-looking runes, but can generate crappy-looking results until you get
the hang of it. Stretch normal dimensions and add curlicues if your rune is still looking too recognizable.
One experiment for varying line widths can be done by going to an art supply store or a craft store and getting hold of an artist’s “crow quill” pen. A crow quill is a pen you dip in ink, with a very narrow nib. When you are drawing a normal line, the line

is extremely thin; but by adding slightly more pressure the line will widen. An experienced artist would use a larger nib pen or
a brush for this, just to get a bigger final picture, but a crow quill is easier for a beginner because the small nib makes it easier to
control ink flow. The more ink your tool can deliver to the paper, the cooler you can make your results, but it also makes it much
easier to screw up. I definitely recommend starting with a crow quill – and they also have the advantage of being cheap.

CODES AND CIPHERS
Codes and ciphers can be a great tool in an adventure, but if they are too difficult they can cause a big problem, too. In

general, remember that what looks easy to the referee is probably a lot harder for the players to figure out. Keep codes very, very
simple if the players are actually supposed to decode them, and provide the key somewhere in case the players can’t figure it out,

or lose patience.
Four different types of codes/ciphers are described below. Each method can be used to generate a variety of actual codes.

1) Shuffle the letters of the alphabet forward or backward by a specific number (this is called the “Julius Caesar Cipher”).
Blood flows
downhill
Example: if the shuffle-number is 2, then the letter “A” would be written as “C,” which is 2 letters forward in the alphabet. The
letter “C” would be written as “E,” and so forth. If the writer wanted to write AC in this cipher, he would write CE.
2) A more complex form of cipher is to assign a number to each letter of the alphabet. The simplest version of this cipher
would be to assign the numbers as A=1, B=2, C=3, etc. “ABC” in this code would be written as “123.” A stronger code might
have a key to show the letter-to-number relation. “A” might be assigned arbitrarily to the number “5,” “B” might be assigned
to the number “1,” and the rest of the letters would also be given numbers to represent them. From the standpoint of writing
an adventure, this sort of cipher would be really annoying to the players because it’s simply too hard or too time-consuming to
break without the key. If you don’t have the key easily available somewhere for the players to find, avoid ciphers that will take

too much time to break.
3) Letters can be substituted for other letters according to a key; these codes are extremely difficult to break without having a
copy of the key.

4) A message can be embodied in an innocuous communication using a formula like this one: “every tenth word is a word of
the real message. Ignore all other words.” A more complicated formula would not use the same interval. Such a key might read
as follows: “the words of the message are words number 10, 15, 30, 41, 50.” In this case, the key would probably be necessary
for players to be able to break the code – although it might be workable if (a) the players enjoy puzzles like codebreaking and (b)

ALTERNATE ALPHABETS AS EASY CODES
An additional form of code is simply to use a different alphabet for normal writing, requiring the players only to figure out
the transliteration. This approach adds mystery into the dungeon, but is relatively easy for the players to figure out if you label
several innocuous rooms with the alphabet before presenting the players with an important piece of information. Some usable
alphabets are shown below. Note that the third column is (pretty much) the Greek alphabet, and can be transliterated by anyone
knowing that alphabet; Tolkien fans or scholars of Norse might also be able to transliterate the Elder Futhark runes of the first
two columns.
