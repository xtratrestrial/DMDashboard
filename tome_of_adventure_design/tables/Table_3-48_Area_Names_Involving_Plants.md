PLACING LANDMARKS
Each level in a large dungeon should have landmarks in it. Just as with the
fractal-type arrangement of the map into areas and transitions between
them, landmarks continue to nail down the map’s geography: without
landmarks, the dungeon map risks being perceived by the players as an undifferentiated whole, where exploration is a boring process with no meaningful
discoveries to be made. Landmarks in general include:
• Big Things (See Table 3-49)
• Level Changes (See Table 3-50)
• Strange Things (See Table 3-53A and Table 3-53B)
• Special Rooms (See Table 3-54)
• Water (See Table 3-77)
