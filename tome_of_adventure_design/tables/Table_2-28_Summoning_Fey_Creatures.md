Ancient Promise. Recital of an ancient promise of assistance is another way to summon a fey creature, but
these are generally difficult to discover, and the fey creature is likely to do whatever it can (later on) to make sure
the recital isn’t passed on or used a second time.

Body Part. If the summoner has a lock of the fey creature’s hair (or some other body part), a particular spoken
charm or magic word could be sufficient to call the creature

Creature’s Name. Knowing the creature’s name might be enough to summon it, particularly if there is a little
rhyme, magic word, dance, or pattern of steps to go along with speaking the name. (For some reason, movement
of feet seems to be much more associated with the fey than movement of arms or hands).
31-40
Creature’s Possession. Some fey creatures are linked to a particular possession (pipes, hat, etc) and can be
called in virtually any way if the summoner has possession of this item.
41-50
Insults and Place. Near the creature’s home, or in some other specified place like a circle of toadstools, a
series of biting insults might call the creature forth … but not necessarily in a good mood.
51-60
Musical Tune. Certain tunes, if played absolutely perfectly and without error, might summon the fey creature.
In order to keep this method from being used over and over again, it might be a tune that backfires dangerously
if not played correctly.

Pattern. Creating the right pattern of crystals, sparkly stones, sticks of wood, branches of fir, etc) might
summon forth this sort of fey creature.
71-80
Place and Activity. The right combination of a place (ring of mushrooms, stone circle, near the creature’s
home, etc) and an activity (lighting a fire with pine cones, dancing, singing, cooking bacon, etc) might be an
irresistible temptation for this sort of fey creature’s greed or curiosity.
81-90
Place, Time, and Speech. It might be possible to summon the fey creature when there is a particular
combination of the time (autumn, midsummer, midnight, lunar phase, etc), the right words, and the right place
(often a crossroads or a forest glade).
91-00
Smells. Cooking a certain combination of (strange) ingredients might summon the fey creature just from a
smell the creature finds irresistible.

GIANTS
There are Norse giants, Celtic giants, Japanese giants (if
that’s how you class the Oni), Ancient Greek giants, etcetera
and etcetera. What’s useful to the adventure-creator is
that these giants are not at all the same in terms of
what they look like, how they behave, and what their
powers are – with one exception being that they are
almost universally pretty stupid. Ancient Greek giants (as opposed to the semi-divine titans) were almost
always deformed in some way; hundred-handed giants

and the one-eyed Cyclops are examples. Norse giants are
powerful enough to stand toe-to-toe with the gods themselves,
and are members of distinct sub-types (fire and frost). Arthurian/Provencal giants do not seem to be members of sub-types,
but they all have brothers (usually in groups of three). The Japanese Oni have taken on a giant or ogre-like standard appearance,
but they are also highly associated with the spirit world and older
folklore doesn’t always portray the Oni in this way (people can
be possessed by oni, for example). Celtic giants tend to be
more intelligent than the giants of other cultures, even tricky

in some cases.
It is an unfortunate result of the early adventure modules
Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl,
and Hall of the Fire Giant Chief that giants are often portrayed
in role-playing games as tribal creatures. This isn’t the case
in folklore, where giants tend to be quite solitary and have
unique powers. There is a lot of room in creative adventure design to take the folkloric model of the solitary
giant with unique powers and/or possessions and use it to

craft an excellent adventure. Avoid, though, the fairy-tale
sequence of the giant and his brothers; it’s too repetitious
– I’ve tried it.
