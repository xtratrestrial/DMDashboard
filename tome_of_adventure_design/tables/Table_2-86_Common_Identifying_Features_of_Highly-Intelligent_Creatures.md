INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER THREE
The previous two books of this series contain tables that are designed to spark ideas: the first book addressed missions and
villainous plans, and the second book focuses on monsters. This third book, on the other hand, takes for granted that you have
already chosen the starting point of a subterranean setting, and provides a vast array of tables designed for this specific type of
adventure. Part One addresses certain general elements that are key to any adventure, subterranean or not, and the remainder
of the book is specifically about adventures in the dark depths of the earth.

There are four general steps in the creative process of
designing a dungeon adventure using this book. Don’t try to
follow them as a checklist, but it’s useful not to go into the
process completely blind, especially when your brain starts to
hurt. The steps are:

CREATIVE OVERLOAD
When you start using the tables in this book you will
immediately encounter “overload,” a ridiculous mishmash
of adjectives and concepts that contradict each other, sound
stupid, and pile upon each other in an excess of details. This

that level with yet another name, plus a load of items and architectural elements with long strings of adjectives attached to
each and every one. Not only that, but most of the adjectives
are vague or even ambiguous.

In the final stanza of the “Jabberwocky,” Lewis Carroll wraps it all up. You’ve got a gleeful

sible for this bad-idea piece of home furnishing. Scrap “inimitable,” because you’ve already got what you need. Here’s a
different take on the throne, though. What if it was a project,
not an item? Maybe it’s part of the backstory, Zar’s effort to
imitate a throne he’d seen described in an ancient book? Hey,
maybe it’s a red book, and the trap isn’t about the physical
throne, it’s about the book. Put some of Zar’s journals into the
dungeon for the players to find, describe a storehouse full of
trap components the characters can use against monsters, and
you’re ready to rock along a completely different direction.
Ambiguity is your volleyball: toss it around before you spike it
into the court.
In the third, fourth, and fifth stanzas of the
Jabberwocky, the initial mishmash of the first
stanza gets resolved into a thread of purpose
and action – even a bit more geography, although the exact location of the tumtum tree
relative to the wabe is … vague at best. Still,
two points define a line, so the geometricians
will be comfortable even if the cartographers
remain deeply unsatisfied. And a line gives
you a direction. Position yourself at a point
on that line (don’t use a tumtum tree – it’s
been done), do a bit of uffish thought, and
then it’s time to take your vorpal sword and
begin cutting out what doesn’t belong. Snicker-snack, and we are on to the next phase.

well-defined objective. The choice is yours.

BASIC ELEMENTS OF ADVENTURE DESIGN

Chapter One has already introduced a series of broadly stated elements for a masterpiece adventure, creating a sort of check-
list (see the Side Box). This section, down here all the way in Book Three, is about “how to build,” not “what to end up with,” so
it has a different set of factors. The Book Three approach reflects the fact that all the elements described in Book One are actually, in practice, all mixed up together when it comes to creating them. They only resolve themselves into nice, neat, categories
once the process is finished and the results are polished up.

while adventuring that can help them, and
what previously unknown thing have they
learned at the end
The Tactical Element: what sorts of physical
features are the memorable “standouts” in
the adventure, and how can the players use
these to their advantage
The Monstrous Element: who or what is actively fighting back?
The Movement Element: is your map well

The Miscellaneous Element: other types of
challenges
OVERVIEW OF THE
BASIC ADVENTURE
ELEMENTS
Certain elements appear in every good adventure, and if
one of them is lacking, you have missed an opportunity. Most
adventures focus more heavily on some elements than others,
and the different emphasis of one element over another can
create highly distinct adventures. However, each element is a
dimension that should not be entirely omitted, even from an
adventure that is dominated by another element. For example, an adventure designed to be a high-tension race against
time will still suffer if the combats don’t contain interesting
tactical elements. An adventure that focuses on an extremely
creative new monster will still suffer if it takes place on a boring map. Keep these in mind while designing the adventure,
and use them as a checklist after you’re done, because some
degree of attention should be paid to each of these factors:
• The Time Element: some sort of race against time, possibly a major factor, possibly a minor factor
• The Motivational Element: what makes the players
choose this adventure
• The Information Element: what do the players start out
knowing, what do they learn while adventuring that can
help them, and what previously unknown thing have they
• The Tactical Element: what sorts of physical features are
the memorable “standouts” in the adventure, and how
can the players use these to their advantage
• The Monstrous Element: who or what is actively fighting
back?
• The Movement Element: is your map well designed as a
game board?
• The Miscellaneous Element: other types of challenges
196 | Tome of Adventure Design (Revised) - Chapter Three
THE TIME ELEMENT: RACING AGAINST TIME
The most important feature of any adventure is the race against time. Virtually all good adventures contain some sort of race against time, although the degree to which the race against time is a feature
of the adventure can vary quite a bit. In a lair-type adventure, a pressing race against time can be used to
prevent the adventure from dragging. On the other hand, in a mega-dungeon where player choice
is at its maximum, the race against time might be little more than limitations on food and light, hit
points and spells. Every delay to check for secret doors or inspect areas for potential traps increases
the risk that the adventurers will be attacked and weakened by wandering monsters before they can
find one of the dungeon’s treasure hoards, but the pressure of a rescue or a villain’s plan coming
to fruition isn’t used to create any further time constraint. All these elements; the traps, the secret
doors, the wandering monsters, and the treasure hoards come together to create a low level of time
pressure that keeps things moving without building tension to a high level. Both methods of structuring the pace of an adventure can create an enjoyable gaming session.
It is worth noting that one adventure type reverses the “race against time” concept, and that is the “hold out for reinforcements” type of adventure in which the characters are under a siege of some kind but can expect help if they can hold out long
enough. In this case, it is the monsters, rather than the players, who are faced with the adventure’s underlying race against time.
