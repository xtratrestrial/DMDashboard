before dissipating.

Insanity, illusions, or hallucinations;
possibly magical, possibly due to pain,
possibly due to emotional reaction
Cloud, wider than a “line” but more oval-shaped than circular

(mold, etc.)
13-16

Poison, non-lethal
Large cloud, possibly enveloping dragon as well (dragon is immune,
of course)
33-36
Emotional reaction or impulses: rage,
sorrow, joy, fear, etc.
Roll twice: breath weapon has a doublewhammy effect.
Long wisp forms into a line perpendicular to the direction in which
it was exhaled, possibly striking several opponents in a front rank
(but with a short range in terms of the distance it travels from the
dragon).
Someone departed
Tactics: shrubs and
trees

Narrow line, glob, or other substance aimed at single opponent (spit,
basically)
45-48
Disease
Pushes, pulls, raises, moves, teleports, or
levitates, as applicable.
Not a breath weapon at all, but a “sound” weapon produced by the
dragon’s voice, song, or roar. (determine range and possibly shape –
probably a cone – as you choose)
Affects memory
Not a breath weapon at all, but a blast from the dragon itself in all
directions up to a certain range. This might be a mental blast, or
might be accomplished by shaking out dust, tiny eggs, or sweat (like
a dog shakes off water).
53-56
57-60
Corrosive to metal, wood, and/or
leather
A characteristic of
the wasp
Missed it by that

Table 2-15: Dragon’s Unusual Breath Weapon continued
61-64
Commands, charms, renders open
to suggestion, confuses, or mentally
influences
Not a breath weapon at all, but an effect that surrounds the dragon
at all times, due to smell, flames, cloud, vermin on skin, etc).
65-68
Transforms, shape-changes, changes
size, or changes state of matter (into
liquid or into stone, for example)
Not a breath weapon at all; effect is caused by dragon’s
concentration upon an opponent or an area.
69-72
Removes one or more senses: blindness,
hearing, or all senses. Alternatively, it
causes “malfunctions” or imperfections
with these senses.
Roll again to determine the shape or delivery of the breath weapon;
but whatever effect it inflicts, it adheres or lingers in such a way that
it gets several chances to cause a failed saving throw or otherwise
affect those who escaped its effects when it first manifested.

Adhesive (glue-like)
Slow-moving floating globule, cloud, or bubble.
77-80
Hypnotic
Smaller cloud, affecting area in front of dragon

strength, intelligence, etc. The effect
might be defined, or the effects might
simply be whatever the rules define for
the lower attribute score.
85-88
Twitching, dancing, or convulsions.
Spits out a grenade-like solid, which explodes to deliver the special
effect in a radius. Might or might not have perfect aim.

Vomited liquid, probably a short cone-shape
93-96
Paralysis
Wide linear blast of breath, filling a narrow but rectangular area in
front of the dragon (affects all within)
97-00
