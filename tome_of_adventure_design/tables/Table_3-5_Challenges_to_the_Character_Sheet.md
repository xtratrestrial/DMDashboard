Table 3-5: Challenges to the Character Sheet
Die Roll

Nature of Challenge
01-25
Ability Checks: A situation requires the player to roll a d20 and score equal or lower than his character’s
appropriate ability score. NOTE: in general, intelligence checks should not be used – it is the player’s
intelligence that should solve problems. Strength, dexterity and constitution, the physical attributes of the
character, are generally the best scores to use for “ability checks.” Avoid using ability checks when a situation
isn’t high tension or difficult. Tying knots in a rope to climb a wall just isn’t the sort of thing that needs a
random factor injected into it.
26-50
Flat chance: These sorts of challenges aren’t affected by the character sheet or anything else. There’s just a
specific chance per person that the effect will happen: whether the chance is 1 in 6 or a percentage is up to you
as the referee. These sorts of challenges are often used when the players are deciding whether or not to risk
something like walking over a rickety bridge. The random factor is used to determine when the bridge falls. So,
the flat chance die roll isn’t the test of player skill; the test of player skill is whether or not to take that chance in
the first place (and how to improve the odds with gadgetry or other innovations).
51-75
Random Selection: having the player pick a card from a set of five, play a game of blackjack or a game of
craps, or choose which hand a coin is in. Do you pick what’s behind curtain #1, curtain #2, or curtain #3?
There’s no skill involved here, obviously, but challenges like this add spice to the game. Sometimes, deciding
whether or not to play the game, or which player will play, is where the exercise in player skill comes up.
76-00
Saving Throw: Whereas ability checks are only linked to the physical characteristics of a regular person,
some challenges are challenges to the character’s experience. Ability checks don’t take the character’s level into
account; saving throws do. Keep in mind that at lower levels, a saving throw is difficult to make.

PART TWO:
DESIGNING A DUNGEON ADVENTURE
INTRODUCTION TO PART TWO
In keeping with the rest of this series, my objective is to provide creative sparks for adventure design by pressing lots of
concepts and elements into the reader’s mind so that the creative subconscious can make sudden, new combinations of them.
Dungeon designing is such a vast topic that I’ve organized these conceptual clouds into topics, so when the designer is struggling
for inspiration in a particular area he can dip into the specific section or sections that seem to be the closest to what he’s looking
for. This mode of organization loses a bit of the lightning-strike power of joining together utterly dissociated concepts, but I
think it ultimately makes the book more usable.

A FIRST, AND IMPORTANT, DISTINCTION: LAIRS AS OPPOSED TO MEGADUNGEONS
There are basically two types of dungeon adventures: the short ones where a mission can be accomplished and finished within a small dungeon (which I call a “lair”), and the huge dungeons designed
for an almost infinite number of game sessions (which I call a “megadungeon.” Most of the tables
in this book are applicable to both types of dungeon adventures; however, if you are designing a
mission-oriented lair adventure, you should keep in mind that anything in here relating to the extent
and size of the dungeon may generate an area that is too large and too empty for a faster paced,
mission-oriented type of adventure.

MYSTERIES AND CLUES
THE CONCEPT OF MYSTERY IN A DUNGEON ADVENTURE
As a starting point for the discussion of dungeon design, it might seem strange to begin with the concept of mysteries and
how to evolve what the players know about the dungeon. But an adventure doesn’t just develop in terms of area explored or
monsters killed; it also develops in terms of the players gaining more and more information about the situation and the location.
Sometimes this knowledge has no practical application in game terms, but make no mistake – it is intensely satisfying to the

if the players finish the adventure with no sense of ever having understood what the hell was
going on. Even in a megadungeon type of adventure, it is highly rewarding to the players
what happened to them, and why the megadungeon eventually became the province
of deadly monsters instead of the original creators and delvers.

UNDERLYING TRUTH:
THE BACKSTORY
A backstory is the history of events that have taken place, both significant and trivial.
Backstories are necessary in order to generate clues and rumors about the dungeon, because you’ll
need something for these clues and rumors to be about. For many designers, knowing the backstory of an area
is also a strong spur to creativity.
There are several approaches to creating a backstory, and the tables in this section are all alternatives for each other – it
doesn’t work to combine the results from more than one table in this particular section.
