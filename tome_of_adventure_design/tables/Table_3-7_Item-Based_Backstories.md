EXAMPLES OF ITEM-BASED BACKSTORIES
Using Table 3-7, one might get a result of: “A statue or idol was introduced in order to cause a problem, with the additional factor of family identity.” The question is how to dream that into the history of a dungeon (or any other sort of adventure you might be planning). The easiest assumption,
since we’ve got the tried-and-true dungeon standby of the statue, is that the thing was introduced
into the dungeon. Clearly, someone provided the statue in order to cause problems, and the only
matter to resolve is what sort of problem a statue might cause for family identity. There are various
possibilities that can be generated solely from that one entry:
The title to ownership of a castle (with the dungeons underneath) was contested between two members of a family, the Azon branch and the Zeon branch. According to the Azon branch, Argos Azon
was born before Zaun Zeon, but an ancient statue in the dungeons shows an older Zaun standing
next to a younger Zeon. As minor elements, you might introduce evidence of the battle into the
dungeon, and a few scraps of paper about which son was older. As a more major element, you might
decide that the benevolent and kindly Azon family was displaced by the evil and sinister Zeons, with
effaced murals of the Azons, broken statues, etc.

On the other hand, the same backstory elements could be used to build a dungeon history in which
an individual is trying to claim that he is a member of a powerful family. The family cannot allow this because the person is a pirate, or a murderer. Since there is an old statue of some family
member who looks almost exactly like the roguish newcomer, the family arranges to have the statue
hidden away in the depths of a dungeon beneath their castle. Since the outsider is a pirate, perhaps
he launches a recovery mission – and if he’s a pirate, he should do it by boat, right? That immediately gives you the idea of a river running through the dungeon map. So in this case, the backstory can
directly give you an idea not just about the dungeon’s history, but some inspiration about the map
itself !
A third possibility, just to illustrate how flexible this table can be, is to look at these results from a
completely different direction than the examples above. Perhaps the priesthood in a deep subterranean community (possibly not even human) is hereditary, and another family challenges this ancient
tradition. An idol in the dungeon gives out oracles and signs, and there is some sort of convocation
called in which the idol is called upon to resolve the question. Here you’ve got an idea about what
the mysterious statue does, possibly some sort of theological dispute, definitely the idea that religious powers might be involved, and all sorts of other possibilities…
