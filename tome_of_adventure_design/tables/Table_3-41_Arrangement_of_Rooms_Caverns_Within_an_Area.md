Arrangement (d100)
Splits in half
Apparently not
valuable
01-10
A central room has one or more “suites” entering into it; the rest of the rooms in the area are part of the suites.
Each suite is a self-contained group of interconnected rooms (each room is not, of course, connected to all the
others, but most rooms will be connected to more than one other room).
Ancient division
11-20
A main corridor branches into two (either as a Y or a T shaped junction). The rest of the rooms in the area are
in suites entering into one of the corridor’s branches. Each suite is a self-contained group of interconnected
rooms (each room is not, of course, connected to all the others, but most rooms will be connected to more than
one other room).
Measuring the
odds
21-30
A single connecting corridor has one or more “suites” entering into it; the rest of the rooms in the area are
part of the suites. Each suite is a self-contained group of interconnected rooms (each room is not, of course,
connected to all the others, but most rooms will be connected to more than one other room).
31-40
All rooms enter onto a single, central corridor that makes one or more turns along its length
41-50
All rooms enter onto a single, straight, central corridor
51-60
All rooms enter onto one central room (probably a room of unusual size, if one is present)
61-70
All rooms enter onto the corridors of a central T-junction or four-way intersection.

71-80
Connecting corridor forms a square, circle, or rectangle (i.e., it surrounds an internal area). About half the
rooms are enclosed by the corridor, and the other half enter onto the outside wall of the corridor.
81-90
Connecting corridor forms a square, circle, or rectangle (i.e., it surrounds an internal area). All rooms are inside
the enclosed area. Rooms may interconnect directly with each other, or might not. The internal area need not
be completely filled by the rooms, and the surrounding corridor might make turns along its path before closing
the “circle.”
91-00
Two central rooms are connected to each other by a corridor; all other rooms enter onto one or the other of the
central rooms

Each arrangement of rooms described in Table 3-41 affords tremendous flexibility; the table merely
suggests the relative relation of the rooms, without much more detail.

having 2 rooms of unusual size, with a roll of 21 for Arrangement: “A single connecting corridor has one or more

NAMING AN AREA (OR LEVEL)
Orcs
The name for an area, if you want one at all, might occur to you while you are mapping or populating it. However, if you
want some additional ideas at the beginning, the following tables can be used to come up with interesting and evocative names
for a particular part of the level (or possibly for the entire level, if you wish).
