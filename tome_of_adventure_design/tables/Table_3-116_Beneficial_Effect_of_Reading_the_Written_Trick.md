Table 3-116: Beneficial Effect of Reading the Written Trick
Die Roll
01-20

Deliberately reading the picture/characters/words causes a magical benefit to the reader (see Table 3-121 for
ideas)
21-40
Simply viewing the picture/characters/words causes a magical benefit to the reader (see Table 3-121 for ideas)
41-60
The picture/characters/words convey helpful information in the form of a map (10%) or other information (roll
on Table 3-17 Information Content for Rumors).
61-80
The trick is to decipher or be able to view or interpret the message contained in a form of Unusual Writing (see
Table 3-117 below).
81-00
The written trick gives instructions that must be immediately followed; following the instructions gains a magical
benefit from Table 3-121 (or, possibly, allows survival of something nasty that suddenly happens) – ignoring the
instructions causes a curse (see Table 3-118 for ideas) or a trap result. For example, if you read “jump to the
left” on a sign, it might be a good idea to jump to the left. On the other hand, perhaps it’s actually a trap and
there’s a pit to the left. Life is unfair.
