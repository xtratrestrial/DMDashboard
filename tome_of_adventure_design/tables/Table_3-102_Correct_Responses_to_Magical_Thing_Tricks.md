RUN-THE-GAUNTLET AND FIND-THE-PATH TRICKS
Certain tricks offer a series of risks, but there is a “rule” that can be followed to get through them safely, or at least with minimal damage. The trick is to figure out that rule.
A related but more complex type of gauntlet is the one where there is not a single “rule” for solving it. It is a series of risks in
which each step contains some sort of result – like a game board. In other words, whether it is obvious to the players or not, they
are playing a modified version of Chutes & Ladders, a modified version of Monopoly, a modified version of chess, a modified
version of Candyland, etc. Again, this will not necessarily be obvious, but it certainly can be.
Uses a specific tool
Wheels and gears
Paper lanterns
A blacksmith
Hard reset
The defining characteristic of this type of trick is that there are “safe” and “dangerous” parts of the trick. For a single-rule
pathway, you figure out how to do the whole thing safely, all at once, or else you fail and do it the stupid, obvious, or wrong way.
For a game-board trick, on the other hand, it is largely random whether you land in the safe or dangerous areas – unless you, as
the adventure designer, add some element in which the players can affect their movement through the series.
So, this section offers sets of tables for (1) Single-rule pathways, and (2) Game-board type pathways.

SINGLE-RULE PATHWAYS

One possibility for gauging reaction time is to give the PLAYERS only a limited amount of time to respond (“you have five
minutes to decide”), counting slowly to five before a bad thing happens, or using some other method to limit the amount of
decision-time the players have. Don’t over-use this, though. It is a very high-tension trick, and too much high tension can be as
bad as too much low tension.
The artistry in creating a trick like this is to find a Rule of Passage and a Nature of Risk that work well together. They should
“feel” right in combination.
