Choose a challenge. Here, the players have to select a type of challenge, rather than a type of reward. There
is a reward allocated to each challenge, but they don’t know what it will be. This turns the game around a bit,
because the players will try to pick the kind of challenge they can beat most easily rather than focusing on the
reward. Perhaps the reward is the same for each type of challenge (if the choices are something like “combat,”
“puzzle,” and “trial by water”), or the challenges might be ordered in terms of increased difficulty for better
rewards (choose among, “Zar’s easy challenge,” “Zar’s difficult challenge,” and “Zar’s suicidal challenge”).
11-20
Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). Some items are good,
some are neutral, and some are dangerous. You only get to choose only once, and you can’t exchange what you
got.
21-30
some are neutral, and some are dangerous. You can take several tries, up to some maximum number.
31-40
some are neutral, and some are dangerous. You only get to choose only once, BUT you can exchange what you
got for something else (probably only one exchange is allowed). Of course, you run the risk of getting something
even worse, if you make an exchange. For games of this type, the “worst” item should either be disguised as
something good (so it’s not returned), should end the game, or should be the only non-returnable item.

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). All of the items are useful
to some degree, but some are very useful (magic sword!) and others are pretty disappointing (a pair of socks).
You only get to choose only once, and you can’t exchange what you got.
51-60
Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). All of the items – except
one – are useful to some degree, but some are very useful (magic sword!) and others are pretty disappointing
(a pair of socks). You can continue choosing items until someone picks the non-useful item. Then the game
is finished. The non-useful item might just be a token that the game has ended, or it might be cursed (or
poisonous, or fill the room with sleep gas, or teleport the party away from the game room, or whatever).
61-70
some are neutral, and some are dangerous. However, taking an item causes you harm (or puts you at risk of
taking harm). You can choose as many times as you want, if you’re willing to take the risks. Example: six bags of
treasure sitting on a pedestal, surrounded by six glowing balls of light. When you take a bag, the corresponding
ball of light fires a blast at you. If you can take the damage, take all six bags. Here’s a possible twist: the pedestal
is inscribed with a warning that five of the glowing balls shoot minor bolts, but the sixth one shoots a death ray.
Here’s another possible twist: you might not get to grab one bag, then another, then another. You might have to
choose how many bags you’re going to take at one swipe (and you only get the one swipe).

Choose from a group of known categories, such as “coins,” “gems,” “monsters,” “spells,” magical items,” etc.
What you get depends on how the trick is designed. Perhaps it always tells lies, and the categories are deceptively
or incorrectly named. Perhaps the result is determined by rolling on a table. Perhaps only one person can pick
each category. Perhaps it is set up so that one person must choose a dangerous-sounding category. Or perhaps it
is just a way to let players decide if their reward for “winning” a trick is going to be cash or potions. Whatever
works best.
Choose from a group of non-concealed items. The items are symbolic representations (or vague pictures) of
what the real gift is going to be, or alternatively you can see the items but not know what their “powers” are,
so there is guesswork involved in the choice. For example, the choice might be among a little sword (you get a
magic sword), a slightly bigger sword (which turns out to be twelve feet long, non-magical, and impossible to lift),
a dog figurine (you get a temporary ally), a wolf figurine (wolf attacks you) and a bottle (which might turn out
to be wine, a potion, or just an empty bottle). Keep in mind that these could be deceptive. The ominous “skull”
picture might get you a talking skull who knows where lots of treasure is kept.
Choose once, blindly, from a set of options. Each option might be good, bad, or neutral. You can’t trade them
in or get a second try, but each option comes with a little clue. The clue, if it is interpreted properly, will let you
improve the thing you chose in some way. A cursed item might be neutralized, a neutral item become valuable,
and a good item become better (or last longer, or affect more people, etc). But to get that benefit you have to
answer the riddle on the container, or find where “the fire meets the eagle” somewhere in the dungeon, or some
other type of challenge or task.
