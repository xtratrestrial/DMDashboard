Table 1-20: Destruction of Good-Aligned Groups
Die Roll

01-05
Book for children
Minotaurs
Good-Aligned Group to be Targeted (d100)
Intended Method of Destruction (d100)
All followers and worshippers of a particular deity
Alter effects of the group’s activities, turning
the results into something deleterious instead
of beneficial (poisoning new wells, appointing
cruel masters to run the new orphanage, etc.).
Less creative villains might just be sabotaging the
projects once finished (burning the orphanage
instead of turning it into an evil training ground,
for example).
A doll
Decorated with paint
Shriekers
Lots of dirt
Ancient portal
Jaunty
All good-aligned individuals in a particular area
Animal or non-summoned monster trained (or
otherwise prepared by magic, or breeding) to hunt
down the targeted members of the community
Many branches
11-15
All powerful good-aligned individuals in a particular area
Arson directed at a building, holy site, or meeting
place of the community (likely part of a larger
pattern of intimidation)
A meeting of the
nobility
16-20
An association dominated by leaders of good alignment
(ranging from a charitable brotherhood to a guild of
merchants whose leaders are staunchly good)
Arson directed at the residences of members of the
community.
21-25
Anyone disregarding a particular evil-oriented law
(or decree of an evil temple not actually part of the
government) such as a requirement to wear an evil
symbol or worship an evil idol, refusal to contribute to
the army of an evil warlord, etc.
Cause diseases (infection or supernatural)
26-30
Anyone returning from a pilgrimage to a particular holy
site
Economic sabotage
Temporal retractor
31-35
Anyone supporting a good-aligned leader during a time
of evil rebellion and riots
Giving dangerous gifts that do something more
than what they appear to do. Snakes hidden in gifts
are a very simple example.
Narrow window of
opportunity
36-40
Anyone who was present at a particular religious ritual
held in the recent past
Indirect murders by poison or traps. Generally
this will involve enticing community members to a
particular location, or targeting a place where the
members meet.
41-45
Apprentices or henchmen of a powerful good-aligned
individual such as a good wizard. To make this unclear
at the outset, the initial targets might be the apprentices
of the original apprentices.
Infiltration and dissention. The villain has a
way to join (or have one of his minions join) the
community, who will then spread lies that will break
the community apart. Faked evidence might be
involved.

51-55
Followers of a good-aligned prophet’s teachings (possibly
being identified because they wear a particular holy

break or kill the members of the community.

F. VILLAINOUS QUEST FOR ECONOMIC POWER
Wreathed in magic
Economic villains can be those who are simply cruel and oppressive of the weak, they can be masterminds who happen to be
in the money-raising phase of a plan, or they could be one part of a larger scheme. Roll on each column.
The cold star-bane
has cloven and
rent their hearts in
twain…
