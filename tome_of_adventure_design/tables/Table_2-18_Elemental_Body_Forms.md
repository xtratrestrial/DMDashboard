ELEMENTAL PLANE OF ORIGIN
Inventing an elemental creature can go along one of two creative avenues: either it’s a new and innovative use of one of the
four basic elements (fire, water, earth, and air), or it’s based on an unusual element. The primary elements are the first four
entries, so if you want a “traditional” elemental you can roll a d4 and move forward. Note also that if you want to generate
The radiant spear
Castle on a rock
Wreathed in
energy
something truly unusual, roll twice and consider that your element might be from the intersection of the two indicated elements.
