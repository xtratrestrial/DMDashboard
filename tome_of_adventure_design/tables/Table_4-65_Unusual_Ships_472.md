Tome of Adventure Design is a comprehensive, start-to-finish resource for
designing fantasy adventures for your favorite tabletop role-playing game. It
is system neutral, and can be used with virtually any fantasy game. This book
includes random generation tables for almost every step of the design process:
locations, villainous plots, designing new monsters, and bizarre environments
in strange, unknown planes of existence. Thousands of micro-prompts in the
margins add additional brainstorming power to the process, and the book is
filled with design advice from award-winning author Matt Finch.

that passage. It’s perfect. The moment when two, three, or more nonsensical,
fragmentary, contradictory notions gel into a coherent and fresh idea is
