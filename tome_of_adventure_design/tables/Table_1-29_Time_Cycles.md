Apogee and Perigee
(solar, lunar, or other)
Perigee is the closest point in the orbit of two celestial objects, and Apogee is the
farthest point. Obviously, the orbit has to be elliptical, not circular, in order to have
closer and farther points in the orbit. Keep in mind that this near-far relationship
could exist between all kinds of celestial objects, not just suns and moons. Comet cycles
are based on apogees and perigees, meteors move around with apogees and perigees,
and even magical structures could have such a relationship to each other. Magical
objects on the earth might activate only when a sun or moon is close; or perhaps the
magical objects are huge metal blocks placed in the sky by some forgotten, ancient
species, designed for some inscrutable purpose…
Calendar Cycles
Many cultures group years into a repeating cycle, treating different years much as
Western culture interpreted the zodiacal segments of a single year. The Chinese
Calendar, for example, follows a cycle of the Year of the Rat, Year of the Ox, Year
of the Tiger, Year of the Rabbit, Year of the Dragon, Year of the Snake, Year of the
Horse, Year of the Goat, Year of the Monkey, Year of the Rooster, Year of the Dog,
and Year of the Boar. Certain characteristics are attributed to people born in the
different years.
Celestial Cycles
The zodiac is a division of the sky into twelve regions, each called a “house.” The
regions are: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius,
Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Each house is associated with behaviors and with a
particular metaphorical emblem. A fantasy world might have different zodiacal signs,
or a different method of interpreting the movements of the stars. The zodiac is linked
to the solar year, not the lunar year.
