* If the Transition is to a special seventh area, add +20 to the die roll, treating any result over 100 as an architectural trick.
If the result is a normal door (including secret and concealed normal doors) then there is a 100% chance of a complex trick
being associated with it. For all other results for transitions to a seventh area, the chance of a simple trick is 75%, and if there
is no simple trick then the chance of a Complex Trick is 100%.
