As mentioned in the Introduction, the tables in this chapter are for top-down adventure creation, for referees who prefer to

referees who prefer to build outward from evocative details, fitting the backbone into the details rather than vice versa. Never be
afraid to go back and change even the fundamental premises of an adventure if your later ideas cause it to evolve in a new direction. Writing an adventure is not a linear process, and creativity is not an orderly process. It’s more like a jigsaw puzzle – there’s
no predicting which parts of the puzzle will start coming together until you start.

INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER TWO
This second chapter focuses on monsters – mainly on creating new ones for use in an adventure. Monsters aren’t quite the “top level” of
adventure design, like locations and missions, but sometimes they are the primary and driving force behind the creation of an adventure,
giving rise to the location or the mission instead of vice versa. I can think of many of my own adventures that were sparked by monsters,
and when I’m beginning the adventure creation process I often look for ideas by paging through monster books. Like the first book in this
series, the objective is not to provide on-the-fly tables for quick use. There are other monster-generation books which already do this quite
well. Instead, this book is designed to tap a deeper creative wellspring – which can be hard when you’re under time pressure with players
tossing potato chips at you and asking if you’re ready to start. The book can be used for on-the-fly ideas, but to use it at full power, so to
speak, it works best ahead of time. It’s a doubly powerful tool when used in conjunction with the first book of the series, but it absolutely
isn’t necessary to have the first book in order to use this one.
MONSTERS GENERALLY
One of the best ways to come up with the idea for an adventure is to start with a monster,
or combination of monsters, and work from there. And if you’re lucky enough to get the
sudden inspiration for a brand new monster, often the adventure will write itself from there
almost without further effort.
Good monsters are more than just an agglomeration of statistics and abilities thrown together. In many cases, what you need to create a monster (especially if it is supposed to inspire
an adventure) is some other detail besides or in addition to the monster’s combat profile. In
many cases, those additional details can define a combat profile much better than the bruteforce method of generating trial-and-error combinations over and over again.
This chapter is divided into two main parts: generating monsters by specific type (undead,
etc.), and a set of general tables. The general tables can also be used as a starting point, beginning with the monster’s Combat Profile, but this method calls for slightly larger creative leaps
than starting with the type. Most of the details generated from the monster type tables will
refer the designer to one or more of the general tables in the second section.
