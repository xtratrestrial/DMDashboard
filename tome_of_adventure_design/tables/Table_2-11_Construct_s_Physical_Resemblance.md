CONSTRUCT’S LOSS OF CONTROL
One feature of constructs in folklore is the potential for them to go out of the creator’s control. Consider Walt Disney’s The
Sorcerer’s Apprentice and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein as examples. Many versions of the original golem folktale (in which the golem
is created by a Cabbalist rabbi to protect the Jews of Prague from a pogrom) also include the golem’s attempt to remain “alive”
once its purpose is served. In general, this theme is more applicable to constructs that are animated by an imprisoned or summoned spirit rather than those which are purely mechanisms or magically-augmented medieval technology. Not every construct
should be subject to loss of control, or the theme becomes a bit overused.
