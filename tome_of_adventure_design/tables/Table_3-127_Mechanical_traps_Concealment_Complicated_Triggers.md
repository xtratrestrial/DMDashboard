Trap Concealment (d100)
Complicated Trigger (d100)
Alcove
A chemical requires a certain level of coolness to remain inactive. Nearby
flames (such as torches) cause it to react and activate the trap
Altar
A chemical requires a certain level of heat to remain inactive. Shadows
cause it to react and activate the trap
Aquarium
A coating of grease covers a substance that heats up when exposed to air;
if the grease is smeared, the heat of the chemical reaction activates the
trap
Flashes of light
Barrel or cask
A feather is suspended over a very delicate pressure plate. If it is blown
down by air currents, it will activate the trap when it lands (so would other
very light objects)
Shadow bird
Bath or basin
A glass globe (possibly quite small) contains a chemical that is highly
reactive when exposed to air. If the globe breaks (and is still in the right
place) the heat of the chemical reaction activates the trap
Bed
A hanging object or an object resting on the floor holds down a vertical
tripwire. If the object is removed, the tripwire flies into the ceiling
(probably due to a counterweight) and the trap is activated
Book
A highly reactive powder is located upon a heat sensor of some kind.
Body heat, oils in skin, or exhaled carbon dioxide concentrations (three
different triggers, here) cause the powder to react and activate the heat
sensor or burn through a thread

of light, but if that item is moved, the light will hit the photoreceptor and
activate the trap

Change-up. A hammer is held suspended by a latch, which, if opened
will cause the hammer to strike an obvious pressure plate. That pressure
plate HAS to be hit in order to temporarily de-activate another, hidden,
pressure plate in the floor. The pressure plate in the floor is the one that
activates a trap.
