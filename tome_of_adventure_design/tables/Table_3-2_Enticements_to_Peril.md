THE INFORMATION ELEMENT
A good adventure begins with snippets of information the players can use, should provide both useful and useless clues in the
middle of the adventure, and conclude with (or develop as the adventure progresses) some sort of “revelation” that most people
don’t know. The revelation doesn’t have to be anything earth-shattering; it could be as simple as the fact that the monsters came
into this area because there is a famine in their normal hunting grounds. In many cases, the revelation is either why the area
became dangerous (see Tables 3-6, 3-7, 3-8 and 3-9 for ideas) or the fact that the monsters are actually in the service of some
greater threat. In many cases, the revelation of this underlying mystery may be the starter knowledge for another adventure if
the players decide to act upon it, but this isn’t necessary and can actually begin to feel formulaic if the “new adventure hook”
becomes a standard feature of each and every one of your adventures, session after session.

THE TACTICAL ELEMENT
Certain types of challenges are common to all adventures, whether wilderness or subterranean. The table below can be used
for minor challenges (similar to solving a trap or trick) but they can also be used to get ideas for the sorts of large challenges that
define a mission. For instance, the entry “close” on the table might be used as the solution for a minor trick, or it might spark the

idea of closing a planar gate that has been unfortunately or untimely opened.
Every adventure should have at least a couple of real showcase locations, but these aren’t necessarily tactical. They might be
something that’s just visually striking, or a really interesting “boss” monster, or a mental challenge. Even if it’s not one of the
showcase locations, though, an adventure should contain at least one area where pure skill on the part of the players has a huge
effect on the outcome of a combat there.
