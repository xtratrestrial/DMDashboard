Table 4-59: Ocean Floor Features.................................. 469

Pickled onions
Condition red
Itâ€™s broken
somehow
A festival took
place
Crocodiles
A broker of gems
and jewels
Absentminded
The food reveals
the way
Spotted fur
Polluted water
A well-known chef
Circle of the story
Abnormal
```
