Basic Form (d100)
Specific Type of Form (d100)
Bamboo
Limbs or body-part moves, but the rest of the plant is immobile (rooted). The plant is
purely a melee fighter. (Roll on Table 2-74: Limb Attacks)
Broad leaves
Limbs or body part moves, but the rest of the plant is immobile. The plant uses a special
attack to augment damage from the limbs: roll on the Limb Attacks Table (2-74) to get
ideas for the limbs, and roll on Table 2-61 to get ideas for the nature of the augmenting
attack.
Bush or shrub
“pulling” attack to draw prey to the limbs: roll on the Limb Attacks Table (2-74) to
get ideas for the limbs, and roll on Table 2-61 to get ideas for the nature of the special
pulling attack.
Cone
Limbs or a body part of the plant move (roll on Table 2-74 for ideas), but the rest of
the plant is immobile. The plant not only uses a special “pulling” attack to draw prey
towards it, but also has a special attack to augment damage from the limbs. Roll on both
columns of Table 2-61 to determine the nature of the pulling and augmenting special
attacks.
Coral-type growth
No part of the plant moves, but it delivers a poisonous or transformational substance
into its near vicinity. Delivery mechanisms include: spores, smells, spiked seed-pods
on the ground, blown leaves, and gases. The result of falling prey to these substances
include turning into a similar plant, turning into a plant-creature controlled by the plant,
turning into a seed-carrier for the plant, or just dying to create fertilizer. Keep in mind
that creatures killed for fertilizer might also be caused to rot faster than normal after
dying.
26-30
Fern
No part of the plant moves, but it has mental powers. These probably include
the telekinetic ability to damage opponents using nearby rocks or equipment, or
even picking opponents up. Other possibilities include mental powers that mimic
enchantment-type magic – the plant can dominate someone’s mind to create an ally
(who will later be used to fetch fertilizing carcasses to the plant’s roots).
31-35
Grass-like stalks
The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility types). It is purely a melee
fighter, using its movement ability solely to get into close enough range for hand-tobranch combat. Roll on the Limb Attacks Table (2-74) to get ideas for how it attacks.
