THEMATIC IDEAS FOR MASTERMIND HUMANOID SPECIES
If the entire species is considerably more intelligent than humankind, the concept probably requires more detail. A species of
masterminds will travel in smaller groups instead of tribes, individuals may have minions from another species, and the species
may make a recurring appearance in more than one adventure. The table below offers various thematic groupings of ideas
Rakshasa
A distant thunder
that can work together for the “signature” element of a mastermind humanoid species. The items in each theme are sometimes
contradictory, and the themes are vague and open-ended. They are intended to spark thought processes, not to provide a closed
and complete list.
An artisan
Wizard-killer
