• The Draw: This first stage might or might not be present; it is a mechanism that brings the party into the area
where the trap can take effect and/or triggers the trap.
• The Prison: The second stage is virtually always present; an element that holds the characters in place or in a
particular location.
• The Kill Mechanism: The third stage is an element that kills them slowly in that location.
A cloak of feathers
Moonbeams
The value of the
individual
• The Kill-switch: The fourth element, which is virtually always present in a slow-kill trap, is a kill switch or mechanism of escape.
A glass of wine
• The Complication: The fifth element, which will not always be present, is a distraction or complication.
An attribute of a
mushroom
