Actual dice are rolled to see where individual party members go (in other words, the party gets split up as the
game is played)

The choice or random uncovering of a symbol moves the party to a location matching that symbol. A new
choice of symbols might be presented at each new location. These can be arranged in progressive sets to
make sure the party doesn’t keep moving backward too much. For example, imagine that there are 9 locations,
identified with tiles numbered 1-9. At each location, the party draws a tile to see where they go next. The
starting set of tiles only has the possibility to move to locations 1, 2, and 3. Locations 1, 2, and 3 offer a set of
tiles between 1 and 4. Eventually the party will thus get to location 4. At location 4, the set of available tiles no
longer includes locations 1-3; now the available set of tiles runs from 4-8. In locations 5-8, there is the possibility
of reaching location 9. Thus the pathway is divided into locations 1-3, 4, 5-8, and 9. Symbols can include
anything – runes, playing cards, coins with different denominations, pictorial representations of what is in the
various locations, etc.

In each location along the path, there is particular action the party must take to move forward. Forward
movement might be one “square” at a time; or different actions might allow the party to hop forward more than
one “square,” possibly with stupid actions dropping them backward.

Use the results from any board game you have ever played, from Monopoly to Chutes (Snakes) & Ladders. For a complex
version of this, you can use other types of tricks inside this one. An architectural trick might effectively be one of the squares, for
