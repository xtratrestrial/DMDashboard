VERMINOUS CREATURES
Verminous creatures are often relatively small, and are usually the “trash-collectors” of a dungeon or other area. In some cases, you might want to have larger
verminous creatures (a mutant or something), and these tables will work fine for the
larger specimens as well. However, oozes also serve well for this type of monster, and
so do the “macrobiotes.”
