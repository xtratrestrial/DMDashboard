Table 4-20: Odd Customs of Dress
Die Roll

To Whom it Applies (d100)
Strange Mode of Dress (d100)
01-05
All Females.
A box or other small container. This might be
for documents, or it might simply have a random
connotation for the people of this culture.
06-10
All Males.
A particular item of clothing, also of a particular color
11-15
All married people. Also, roll a 50% chance to see if
it’s a different mode for married males and females.
Badge, embroidered or sewn with the relevant
identifications or symbolic markings
16-20
All members of a particular profession (this would
probably extend to visitors), such as wizards, fighters,
and thieves. Go with the more interesting professions:
this is just extraneous detail if it doesn’t apply to at
least one party member.
Bells, of any size ranging from jingling little bells up to
a cowbell around the neck
21-25
All members of a particular bloodline or species.
Facial marking (paint, henna, etc.) of a particular
color or pattern
26-30
All members of a particular religion. This might be
a sign that the religion is despised, but could also be
a city-wide token of pride for the dominant religion.
Alternatively, it might be that each of several religions
sports a different identifying mode of dress.
Feathers (probably but not necessarily from a
particular type of flying creature)
31-35
All members of one particular guild. This is likely the
most prestigious guild, or a guild whose members are
despised.

Lightning-charged
trees

Green mice

Egrets
36-40
All People who are not members of one of the city’s
official guilds.
Gloves, tights, or codpiece
41-45
All People. This includes both residents and visitors.
Visitors would be given, or would have to acquire, the
proper article of dress before being allowed to enter.
Item of silverware, such as a spoon of a specific type.
It might be that such a person is only allowed to eat
with this particular implement, or it might be symbolic
of a past event.
Peasant Unrest
All Residents.
There is a 50% chance that a second strange mode of
dress is used by one subgroup: roll again to find this
subgroup, ignoring results of “All Residents” or “All
People.” Mask or veil
All unmarried people. Also, roll a 50% chance to
see if it’s a different mode for unmarried males and
females.
Metal collar, bracelet, or other non-decorative piece
of metal
The law
56-60
All visitors.
Nose ring or earring(s)
61-65
All who are parents. Also, roll a 50% chance to see if
it’s a different mode for fathers and mothers.
Overlong sleeves or no sleeves (e.g., a vest)
66-70
Anyone who has passed some sort of test or challenge
(a manhood/womanhood ritual, for example). It
might be that if the characters don’t undertake this
ritual they will have some difficulties due to lack of
respect. In some cases the ritual might merely be
expensive, or in some cases it might potentially be
lethal.
Pointed hat (50% chance to require 1d3+1 points)
71-75
Criminals of a particular type (e.g., the “Scarlet
Letter” worn by adulterers in puritan New England).
Pointed shoes (including boots or slippers)
76-80
Each odd-numbered visitor, or some other random
selection process that makes some party members
wear the garment and others not be allowed to.
Ribbons (whether or not of a particular color)
81-85
Members of a certain political faction.
Specific type of relict from your family
86-90
Members of a particular social class. This might be
a high class, or it might be a shunned class such as
Hindu “untouchables.”
46-50
51-55
91-95
96-00
Members of each political faction have a certain
identifying mode of dress. One historical example
would be the “green” and “blue” factions in ancient
Constantinople.
Members of each social class have a distinctive article
of dress. Roll only once on the next column, and use
different varieties of the same result: for example,
if the next column indicates a “pointed hat,” use a
one-pointed hat for one class, a non-pointed hat for a
second class, two points for a third class, a so on.

ODD BEHAVIOR
Odd behaviors have to be something that the Referee can mimic while the adventurers are talking to people in the city/settlement, or they won’t make much of an impression on the players. When this works, however, the players will definitely remember
the city. These are cultural behaviors that the entire city (or a subgroup) uses, not just distinctive mannerisms of a single individual.
