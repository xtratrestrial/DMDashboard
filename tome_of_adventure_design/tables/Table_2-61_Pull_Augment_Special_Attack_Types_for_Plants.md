The plant has the equivalent of a mouth, which
could include splitting a large part of itself open
(like a Venus Flytrap) or even splitting its whole body
open. The mouth is the main source of damage: it
might crush its victims, or it might have the plant
equivalent of teeth, using internal thorns or spines.
A mouth with a sludgy interior might slop the victim
with digestive juices. Unless the plant is mobile and
fast, it will need some sort of motile grabbing limb to
get its victims into the mouth.
Hallucinogenic dust, spores, or smell causes victim to see
the plant as something attractive that he wants to touch.
An attractive member of the opposite sex or piles of
treasure are good examples, although the specific nature
of your adventure might suggest other ideas.
11-20
The plant has motile vines or tendrils that inflict
an unusual type of additional damage, usually
automatic and progressive if the tendrils manage to
grab and hold the victim. The following are ideas for
such damage: poison (instantly lethal, progressively
lethal, or progressively damaging), heat, cold, acid,
electricity, squeezing, and thorns.
The plant can animate other nearby plants (probably
symbiotes) so that they entangle and pull prey toward it.
21-30
The plant enfolds its victims and begins to digest
them using acidic sap or other digestive substances.
The plant uses a rudimentary form of magic to enchant
its prey. The victim walks toward the plant, and takes no
other actions.
31-40
The plant enfolds its victims and begins to
incorporate them into its own body, changing them
to plant matter or lacing them through with tiny
digestive tendrils that aren’t easily removed.
its prey. The victim will eventually be eaten, but first it
will try to pull nearby creatures (other characters) toward
the plant.
41-50
The plant’s motile limbs can cause the victim to
become paralyzed or otherwise helpless (go limp
from pleasurable narcotic, be electrically stunned,
turn rigid from a poisonous substance, etc).
The plant issues a highly attractive narcotic smell, which
causes victims to forget what they are doing and move
toward the plant.

Confusion. A substance on the plant’s motile limbs
acts like a drug, causing victims to move, or even
attack, randomly.
The plant has an organ (possibly even a human-looking
eye) that functions as a gaze attack. The organ might
always be visible, or part of the plant might open up to
reveal it during combat. Those affected by the attack will
move toward the plant.
The plant has a substance (coated with sap or
slime) or an injector (thorns) on its body. Motile
limbs grab victims and carry them to the body so
that these short-range weapons can be used. The
substance causes a transformation in the victim. He
progressively turns into a “plant zombie” with seeds
attached to him, and starts traveling around while
shedding the seeds (this is how the plant reproduces).
The plant has a rudimentary teleportation ability. For an
interesting twist, try having teleportation be the result of
a failed saving throw against a Physical Distance Attack
on Table 2-61. That’s pretty darn weird.

The plant’s motile limbs stun a victim for short
periods of time when they hit (a saving throw might
or might not apply). If the limbs cause clubbing-type
damage, the stunning is simply caused by the force
of the blow. If the limbs cause cutting or piercing
type damage, then the stunning is caused by a weak
poison in the creature’s sap.
The plant zaps potential victims with a magical ray,
hypnotizing or charming them. They proceed to walk
zombie-like into the plant’s clutches.
The plant is a dangerous one, with lethal poison on
its limb attack. The poison might not be instantly
lethal, but it’s a possibility – especially if the plant
is rooted to the ground, since an escaping poison
victim won’t die near the roots. Slow poison; no
fertilizer.
The plant can grow thin roots (about the width of twine)
that crawl out very quickly from the plant’s central body.
If one of these roots manages to catch up with prey, the
central plant pumps nutrients into it, letting it thicken
to the width of a rope that can haul the victim back by
the ankles. This sort of attack makes for a good tactical
encounter, since the rootlets can grow around corners
and the party might have to divide its efforts between
attacking the plant’s central body or hacking at little
rootlets.
