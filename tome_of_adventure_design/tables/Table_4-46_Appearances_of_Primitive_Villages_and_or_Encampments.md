Death masks or fetish masks all over the place. Possibly these are consulted for advice, and they might even give
good advice!

Fires burn in a strange, spiritual color (either the result of magic, or the result of using strange wood or other
fuel)
31-40
Heads staked out or enemies hung in trees
41-50

Taboo areas where outsiders may not pass
61-70
Tents made from leather that is from armored beasts and still has the armor

PLANAR ADVENTURES
NOTES ON PLANAR ADVENTURES
Planar adventures are difficult to design, but they can produce some of the most exciting peak moments in a long-running
campaign. They often represent the culmination of some sort of effort, and they are in many ways the “badge” of an experienced adventuring party. However, what makes a planar adventure distinct from other adventures is also what makes it difficult
to design – some of the ground rules of normal reality are changed, which means a lot of pre-planning by the Referee to make

these changes work well as part of an adventure. The adventure needs to be (a) highly creative in terms of these changes, but
also (b) still playable. If the players can’t quickly grasp what their characters’ new capabilities and restrictions are, the whole
situation will seem random and contrived.
By using these tables, you’ll get ideas for consistent (but weird) physical rules that might apply across the board in the new
plane, or at least in the area where the adventure takes place. Having the idea established as a “rule” will help you to build more
ideas from it, and will allow you to convey more easily to the players what their new capabilities, risks, and limitations are.
After you’ve decided what will be “new” in the planar environment, a good way to make sure it will be a fun setting is to
review some of the basic tenets of the game – if your planar setting takes advantage of these elements, then you are probably on
track:

decide when to use and when to conserve. This could range from potions of fire resistance in an elemental plane, to air supply
2) It’s a game of exploration. Beware the tendency to make other planes of existence into a single type of terrain with little
variation and few landmarks.

3) It’s a game of tactics – have you used the planar/dimensional setting to create unusual tactical challenges with odd combat/spell effects?
4) It’s a game of challenging the players’ skill. Does your planar adventure only challenge the character sheet (i.e., using saving throws and damage), or are you also using the setting to create challenges that can only be solved by smart thinking?
