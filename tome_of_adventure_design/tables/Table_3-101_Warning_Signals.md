Moon interactions
01-10
Abstract Special Effect. The Thing, or something near it, produces energy in the form of an Abstract Special
Effect (see Table 3-98).
Magical speech
11-20
Architectural Change. Something about the surrounding architecture changes. Statues might turn to face
one wall, or to face the characters. A door might appear, a portcullis might rise, etc. Whatever this is, it needs to
be related to the way the trick delivers its “final blow,” whether that’s a benefit, a curse, a disease, or whatever.
As an incredibly simple example: if the result of giving the magic statue the wrong answer to its riddle is going
to be a bunch of fireballs, then one possible architectural change could be the emergence of cannons from the
walls. Feel free to add more subtlety in your own creations, of course.
Die Roll
21-30
Effect on Adventurers. This is a wide category of strange possibilities – it would include: party members
changing position, seeing visions, smelling something, being teleported places (possibly the whole area is
teleported), having sudden flashes of insight, seeing things closer than they are, or having senses of foreboding
(or other emotions).
31-40
Light Effect. Eyes, or some other part of the Thing, light up. Alternatively, something lights up in the
surrounding area. If the area is already lit, then the nature of the lighting changes (color, location, direction,
brightness, etc.).
41-50
Posture Changes. For statues or other representations, this just means moving, shifting, standing, or sitting.
For static things like pillars or pools, it means turning, rising, shifting, sliding, or moving contents around (waves
or ripples form in the pool, for instance). If the thing has a face, changing facial expressions are a possibility.
51-60
Randomize the Remainder of the Trick. Jot down a table in your notes, with 2-6 possible warning
signals (more than 6 is probably going overboard). These warning signals should probably all be variations on
the same type – by which I mean, 6 different poems, 6 different sounds, 6 different sucker-punches, 6 different
possible changes in posture, etc. Make each warning signal correspond to a different reward or threat, a different
question that it asks, a different question that it will answer, etc. When the party reaches this point in the trick,
you will roll on your table to see what the trick does.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Randomizing a trick is a good idea if the party is likely to keep coming back to this
location, or if you use this dungeon over and over again with different players, but it might be overkill if the
party is only ever likely to see the trick do one thing.
61-70
Sounds. The Thing makes a sound of some kind (sings, clanks, screams, etc.). You could generate a sound
randomly on Table 3-71, but it’s usually best to pick something appropriate based on the type of central feature
involved.
71-80
Speaks Poetry. Produces, speaks, or reveals a poem (maybe just a rhyming couplet, if you aren’t feeling
Shakespearian enough to whip up a quick sonnet in iambic pentameter). Everyone has an inner poet. Go for it.
81-90
Speaks Prose. The item says something like, “What do you want?” or “That pissed me off.” There are also
several places on the internet where you can find a Shakespearian insult-generator. I’m just saying.
91-00
Sucker-punch. The trick hits the party or some of the party with a magical curse, mental condition, or
physical harm (including diseases or slow-acting poison). The name of the game from this point on is to get it
to reverse that condition and hopefully get a benefit as well. For tricks like this, there is usually no further bad
consequence that can happen – the worst that can happen is that you’re stuck with the curse, or will die from the
poison, or whatever. Yes, many tricks work this way BEFORE the party does anything wrong. These tricks are
very much like traps.
