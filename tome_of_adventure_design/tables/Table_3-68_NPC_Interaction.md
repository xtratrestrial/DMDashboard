Table 3-68: NPC Interaction
Nature of NPC (d100)

Initial Attitude Toward
Party (d100)
Primary Potential Value to Party
(d100)
01-10
Adventuring, exploring, or
seeking treasure
Astonished and happy to
see a human face in this
godforsaken place.
Can remove a specific curse the party is
likely to have contracted at this point in the
adventure (this is likely coupled with another
primary benefit, since the curse was probably
involved in getting to the NPC).
11-20
Currently imprisoned
Friendly, possibly for no
particular reason.
Gives Information (Roll on Table 3-17 for
content of Rumors)
21-30
Group of human type
creatures that are completely
disorganized
Hostile and ready to fight
Has a key or other physical item that will be
useful for getting to a treasure, past an obstacle,
or into an otherwise inaccessible area
31-40
Group of human-type
creatures with a leader who
can speak on their behalf
Mercurial or whimsical
responses, possibly changing
temperament at the drop of
a hat.
Leads party to a particular location or acts as a
guide (probably temporarily)
41-50
Is a spy, infiltrator, monster,
shapeshifter, or other type
of being that will eventually
become inimical to the
party. It will likely convey
a primary benefit, but
treachery will be down the
road.
Response – whatever it
might be – is affected by
an enchantment, drugs, or
illusions.
None. Might even be annoying or cause
problematic effects elsewhere in the dungeon.
51-60
Is enchanted as another sort
of being
Response depends entirely
on whether the party has
picked up some item, knows
a password, is wearing
particular garments, or has a
particular appearance (this is
likely a guard of some kind).
Reward for Rescue, or Bounty for Capture
61-70
Is in a very perilous or
precarious situation due
to trap or architecture –
probably trapped in place
Suspicious. Just as suspicious
as the party members are
of him, maybe even to the
point of paranoia.
Will act as diplomat, translator, or interlocutor
on the party’s behalf with a strong monster
who guards access to another location, or
which might give up its treasure to the party
71-80

either for a bounty, rescue,
or something odd (like
delivering a message or
selling life insurance)

Lost as hell.
Thinks they are someone
else (such as a rescue party
or assassins) and reacts as

hostile) or decide in advance
who he will think they are.
Usually this is someone who
is expecting a specific guest.
