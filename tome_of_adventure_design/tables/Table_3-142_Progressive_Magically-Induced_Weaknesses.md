Die Roll

Magically-Induced Weakness (d100)
A chronic
condition
Acid Damage Magical acid is involved with the trap as a secondary feature or complication. If the victim
fails some sort of check (morale, saving throw, percentile chance, etc.) he may be subject to such things as (1)
becoming unable to act due to pain, (2) becoming temporarily blind, (3) having his equipment damaged, or (4)
taking normal damage.
Capture them!
03-04
Adhesiveness and Friction. Magical adhesiveness or slipperiness is involved with the trap as a secondary
feature.
Find the line
05-06
Affect Ground or Rock. Rock might be turning to mud (or changing back), or some other magical effect is
working upon the stone in the area while the characters try to escape.
07-08
Affect Metal. Magical properties of the trap are affecting metal while the characters try to escape. This could
include causing the metal to animate, affecting it as a magnet, making it rust, heating it up, chilling it to deadly
low temperatures, causing it to conduct electricity, shaping it at will, making it brittle, changing its physical
properties, causing it to constrict, or some combination thereof.
09-10
Affect Wood. The trap can animate wooden items, causing them to attack the party.
11-12
Affect Wood. The trap’s properties, magical or alchemical) affect wood in such a way as to make it brittle or
bend it. If the means of escaping the trap involve something made of wood, this might create a serious race
against time.
01-02
13-14
Affects the Use of Limbs. Whether it is because of extreme cold, a spell, or some other magical means, it
is difficult to use one’s limbs while trapped, and it becomes more difficult as time passes. This could be due to
anything from a clumsiness curse, to confusion, to intense cold, to twitching movements.
15-16
Animate Objects. The trap includes some objects that animate and attack the party.
17-18
Asphyxiation. The magical part of the trap removes or reduces the target’s ability to breathe. Death is
not immediate, and the period of time required for the victim to die can be measured out in several ways (see
Table 3-143 (Measuring out Life) or Table 3-128 (Effects of Gas). Don’t worry if the character seems to be able
to hold his breath for an incredibly long time – just assume that he manages to catch a gasp of air somehow
during the process.

Aversion. The magical part of the trap tries to create an aversion to something that is in the trap with the
characters. If they “catch” the aversion, it will make it more difficult to handle the rest of the trap.
Curtained-off area
21-22
Body Infestation. The trap infests the victim’s body with a plant or animal growth
Altered methods
23-24
Burial. If it is not already a feature of the trap, the trap keeps trying to bury the characters in some substance
as they try to escape.

25-26
Clumsiness. If affected, the characters in the trap suffer one or more of the following effects: a penalty to hit,
a penalty to armor class, inability or reduction in spell casting, and/or the chance to drop any items they are
holding. Actual dexterity score is not necessarily affected. The way in which the trap causes clumsiness could
include overloading one of the victim’s emotions (joy, rage, hate, greed, fear); an alchemical reaction (mysterious
chemicals in the waters of the trap); the effects of tiny but continual electrical shocks; or a very weak poison,
curse, or disease.
27-28
Cold Damage. Increasing cold causes progressive damage (or it becomes progressively harder to avoid
damage).
29-30
Compelling Sound. The trap includes a sound-causing feature that tries to magically compel the characters
to do something, or stop doing something. The longer they are exposed, the more difficult it becomes to avoid
the compulsion.

31-32
Constitution Loss. The trap slowly drains constitution from the victims while they are trying to escape. The
effect is probably temporary, but if constitution is the key to surviving the other features of the trap, this could
be a nasty “kicker” to the trap’s overall lethality.
33-34
Dehydrate, Desiccate, Suck Fluids. Some magical feature of the trap sucks blood or dehydrates the victim
(possibly all the way into powder).
35-36
Despondency. The trap causes intense despondency or lethargy, which may keep the characters from even
attempting to escape if they are affected or exposed long enough.
37-38
Dexterity Loss. The trap slowly drains dexterity from the victims while they are trying to escape. The effect
is probably temporary, but if quick hands or graceful movement is the key to surviving the other features of the
trap, this could be a nasty “kicker” to the trap’s overall lethality.
39-40
Dimensional Features. This type of magical trap feature taps other dimensions of time and space to screw
around with the movement or other abilities of the trapped characters.
41-42
Disease. The trap causes a fast-acting disease that gets progressively worse while in the trap.
43-44
Distracting Sound. The trap includes a sound-causing feature that is really distracting, causing problems for
the characters as they try to escape, fight, etc.
45-46
Electrical Damage. The trap causes progressive electrical damage to the target, or small repeated
electrical attacks. There may also be an additional result involved after a certain point, or if a saving throw
fails – possibilities include: random actions for some number of rounds, loss of bodily coordination, mental
disorientation, temporary paralysis, etc.
47-48
Fear. The trap causes magical fear, paralyzing or keeping the affected character from acting (to some degree).
49-50
Fire. The trap includes a magical fire feature – if the victim fails some sort of check (morale, saving throw,
percentile chance, etc.) he reflexively takes some action in response to the fire. These could include: panic for a
couple of combat rounds, trying to put out the fire, or writhing in pain. It might be that the “check” becomes
more difficult as time passes.
51-52
Hallucinations or Illusions. The trap includes magically or drug-induced hallucinations.
53-54
Ice. Magical ice plays a role in the trap, either immobilizing, causing damage, or being slippery.
55-56
Immobilization. Magical immobilization might include dancing, twitching, laughing, vomiting, nausea,
confusion, jumping, floating, talking, scratching, begging for mercy, thinking, arguing, holding one’s breath,
hiding, and meditating.
57-58
Implant Eggs or Larva. While everything else is going on, the trap is trying to inject eggs or larva into the
characters, which will distract them from other parts of the trap.
59-60
Insanity. The trap includes a progressive risk of magically induced insanity.
61-62
Intelligence Loss. The trap slowly drains intellect from the victims while they are trying to escape. The effect
is probably temporary, but if intelligence is the key to surviving the other features of the trap, this could be a
nasty “kicker” to the trap’s overall lethality.

Light, Dark, and Shadow. The trap involves magical light, dark, or shadow to cause a threat to the trapped
characters, or to make it more difficult to escape.
65-66
Luck. The characters in the trap become progressively more unlucky (probably a temporary effect, but a trap
is not the place where you want to suddenly become unlucky).
67-68
Magic Drain (spells). The trap progressively drains away spell power.
69-70
Magic Force. Some sort of magical force pushes or pulls the characters while they are trying to deal with the
rest of the trap.
71-72
Magical Vortex. Mist, smoke, steam, vapor, fog, or some other kind of gas moves in a powerful whirlwind
or series of gusts. The substance might be poisonous, might be choking, might be hot, might be cold, might
conduct electricity, might dispel magic, or could have any number of other properties. It might not necessarily
fill the entire area where the characters are trapped, but would probably move around in that case.

escape.

getting stronger.

Progressively Damaging Sound. The trap includes a sound-causing feature that causes a low but
increasing level of damage.
85-86
Rage. The trap causes rage, either in a series of steps or determined when a saving throw fails. Characters
affected by the rage will probably not be much help in escaping the situation.
87-88
Size and Density. The size or density of the characters is being slowly changed while they are in the trap.
