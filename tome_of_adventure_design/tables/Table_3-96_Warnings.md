Warnings (d100)
01-50
None - This sort of trick hits the party by surprise. Sometimes a surprise-trick just means they have to think
fast, but often surprise-tricks are the more dangerous type – in which the party has to cope with magical results
that have already taken effect on them.
51-53
Antigravity or levitation effect in surrounding area, possibly objects are floating in air (as opposed to the central
feature itself)
54-56
Central feature emits heat, cold, or some sort of electricity or lightning (including a static charge)
57-59
Central feature floats in the air
60-62
Central feature is difficult to approach; it might be protected by a force field, be at the top of a long, winding
ramp, or be on an island in a pool of acid, as examples.
63-65
Central feature is in some way decorated far more than one would expect. This might range from as little as a
coat of paint, all the way up to something just dripping with jewels.

66-68
Central feature moves in unexpected ways. Any movement at all would be unusual in an inanimate object;
living objects might flicker in and out of existence, teleport from place to place, or just move in ways other than
“normal.”
69-71
Decoys. Far from being made obvious, the trick’s central item has several duplicates to prevent it being spotted
as the main feature (a hall of huge statues, or a pile of shoes, as two quite disparate examples)
72-74
Item emits a strange noise other than speech before its actual “trick” manifests
75-77
Item speaks immediately before its actual “trick” manifests; the players will thus have some warning that they
should be careful about their subsequent actions.
78-80
Lighting effect: the central feature glows, burns, or is wreathed in shadow or darkness
81-83
Protective measures or restraints upon the trick are in plain view. One example is chains binding an apparently
inanimate statue.
84-86
The central feature has some anthropomorphic feature (eyes, a carven face, etc). This might be emphasized
with additional magical features such as glowing eyes – the more anthropomorphic the item already is, the more
likely that there will be “something else” added to those features.
87-89
The item/fixture has surroundings that emphasize its importance; it is surrounded by incense burners, is located
at the end of a long hallway, etc. This can include a marked-off area (see tables above).
90-91
The item/fixture is not highlighted by its surroundings, but the surroundings themselves indicate that something
is unusual: a sense of wrongness, a change in temperature, dimming of torches, etc. The presence of a trick is
clear; the central feature is not immediately obvious
