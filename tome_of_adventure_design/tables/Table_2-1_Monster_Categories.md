BEASTS
A beast is a monster that lives in the fantasy world’s natural ecosystem. It
probably isn’t more intelligent than a regular animal, although it might be
unusually cunning. Giant ants and griffons are both examples of this sort
of monster. If your adventure requires an interesting roving predator, or an
infestation of bizarre creatures, this is probably the category you’ll want to use
as a starting point to generate some ideas.
Step 1: Get a Starter Image of the Body Form. Roll on the Creature Attributes table for a basic body form. You’re not locked into this body form, but I have
always found it easiest to come up with interesting details when I’ve got a vague
picture of the monster already in mind. Sometimes the details are interesting
enough to warrant changing the whole concept retroactively to fit them. If
that happens, I consider it a perfect result.
Step 2: Mix Attributes of Two Creatures. Roll twice on the Creature Attributes Table (2-2). Take an attribute from the
first creature (any attribute, your choice) and mix it with an attribute from the second creatures (again, your choice). Let’s say

the cheetah (that was just a starting point) and create a beetle that sings sweetly to draw its prey close for the kill (presumably
with a saving throw to avoid the effects of the song).
Step 3: Fill in the Details. Roll for Special Attacks, Special Defenses, and Defining Attributes on Table 2-64. Tie those
results into the Creature Attributes you’ve already generated, or treat the results as new features to add into the monster’s description.
