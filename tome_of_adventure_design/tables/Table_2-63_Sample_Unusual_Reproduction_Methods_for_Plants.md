Reproductive Cycle
01-20
The plant injects or drops seeds into the water. The seeds become tadpole-like creatures (animal or vegetable, it
doesn’t matter). The tadpoles swim to new locations using their whip-like tails. They die, and the internal seedmatter beings to grow as a new plant.

21-40
The plant doesn’t just produce seeds – it produces flying insects (whether these are true animals or plant-insects
doesn’t matter). The insects fly about for a while, die, fall to the ground, and germinate into new plants.
41-60
By whatever means the plant might also grab hold of adventurers, it grabs birds and small animals such as
rabbits and chipmunks. It injects these creatures with seed-larva. Then it releases the small creature, which
carries along on its merry way until the larva eat it from within and germinate in its dead carcass.
61-80
The plant drops a “phase one” seed into the ground. The phase one seed grows into a small, mobile plant that
scurries away. The mobile plant proceeds to scatter “phase two” seeds as it travels. The “phase two” seeds grow
into the original plant form, which then begins to produce more “phase one” seeds.
81-00
The plant produces a shiny, gem-like seed. These are picked up by birds, which carry them away to put into
nests. When the seeds sprout, they send out little vines that feed upon eggs.

UNDEAD
In folklore, almost all undead creatures arise from some sort of break in the normal life cycle as that
culture defines the life cycle (and that’s not always the same in all cultures). Some ceremony wasn’t
performed – often burial or last rites, or some action taken by the undead person during his life rep-

resented a breach of the natural order of things. The tables below focus on this aspect of Undeath,
although first there’s a comprehensive list of undead “types” to help you focus on the explanation,
which you might generate with the later tables. Obviously, if your “explanation” of the undead
creature generates a fantastic idea that doesn’t mesh with the type, stick with your imagination, not
with the tables.
