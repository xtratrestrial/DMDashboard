MAGIC AREA TRICKS
Area tricks are those in which an “area” plays a role; the trick affects an area when it “activates,” or else it’s triggered by entering the area (possibly with the additional requirement of taking an action).
• The trick’s actions are described in terms of a combination of four possible elements:
• Correct Action
• Wrong Action
• Beneficial Magical Condition (see Table 3-118)
• Curse (see Table 3-118)
Many area tricks have the area marked off in some way, so they are puzzles rather than just a series of surprises. This is largely up to you, although tables are included to give you ideas for marking areas.
