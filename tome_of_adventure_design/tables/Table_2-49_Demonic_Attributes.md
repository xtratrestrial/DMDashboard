SUMMONED CREATURES (PLANAR CREATURE TYPE)
Summoned creatures are those that aren’t demonic in nature, but come from some other dimension, alternate reality, other reality, or from a non-demonic plane of existence. They don’t ordinarily cross over into the material plane, and are usually called
forth for some specific purpose. From my experiences with using the following tables, it works best to get an idea about what it’s
summoned to do (Table 2-49) before generating information about the creature’s body type– this helps to adjust the monster’s
physical appearance when you roll on Table 2-50.
