on the lord’s land and repairing village structures. Will not be
present in a castle without a village, and even so would probably live

Porter
Responsible for keeping track of who enters and leaves the
fortification, and for granting access. Usually stationed in the
gatehouse, although not normally part of the actual guard. This
is the person you have to convince, if you’re trying to sneak in

CITIES AND SETTLEMENTS
PREPARING FOR A CITY ADVENTURE:
City adventures are perhaps the most complicated type of adventure to create, since there is so much activity going on around
the characters at all times. Before trying to design a city adventure, it’s a good idea to stop and think about why the characters
are in the city, and what level of detail you’re going to need to handle that sort of adventure. If the adventure is a mere shopping
trip, you will bog everything down if you try to make the players listen to the details of every shop and residence they see, street
by street, with descriptions of the people passing by … when all they want is to replace a broken longsword and get back to
adventuring.
If this is the first time you have used this city (i.e., it’s not a feature that has recurred several times in your campaign already),
then it’s important to brand something memorable about the city onto the players’ minds. This “capsule” detail about the city
should cover two things: a visual image of the city; and one simple detail about how the city is risky or gives a significant benefit
to the characters themselves, on a personal level. Players do not remember details – they think about things in terms of one or two
major features. Rather than inundating them with details to filter, go ahead and smack them with what’s really memorable right
at the beginning. Ideas for the sorts of quirky things that can make a city memorable are listed in Tables 4-18 to 4-22. As a general rule, a city should almost be a caricature of itself – focus really, really hard on the city’s central characteristic, at least until
the players have it drilled into their heads. Once they “know” the city, of course, you can introduce more details, but still: always

THE THREE TYPES OF CITY ADVENTURES
There aren’t sharp distinctions between the three types of adventures listed here – many city adventures are in the gray areas
between these categories. As things get more complicated – which happens because you offer a “hook” to something more complex, or because the players decide to interfere more and more in the city’s business – the adventure will tend to slide closer and
closer down the scale toward the exploration type (see below).
Shopping Trips. Shopping trip type adventures aren’t really adventures at all, or, at least, not at the beginning. The players
begin this sort of adventure when they want to buy equipment, get healing, find information, or undertake some other mundane,
non-adventuring type of activity. Most of the time, you should almost hand-wave this sort of trip into a city. If the players aren’t
trying to gather information or do anything other than buy things, then you’re only getting in the way if you try to turn it into
an adventure. For this sort of visit to a city, it’s usually enough to give the players the “capsule information” about the city, and
perhaps a sketch map of the major streets with the important shops and temples marked.
Mission Adventures. Sometimes, however, the characters are venturing into the city with a mission. Missions normally
have two phases: an information-gathering phase and a combat phase. In the information-gathering phase, tactical information
is far less important than knowing which people have the important information and how the party might track it down. On the
other hand, when the mission turns into combat, you will usually need to have a very small-scale tactical map of where the
combat will take place. When creating such a map, take advantage of the features that are unique and special to city adventures:
balconies, multi-story buildings, rooftops, the possibility of using the open sky above, and bystanders. Depending on the adventure and where it might lead, it’s possible that you’ll need more than one such map, representing two alternative places where a
fight might break out, or for two places in a “series,” in which the second location is a place the characters will only reach if they
are “succeeding” in the adventure. For a mission adventure, you will need not only the low-detail city map used in a shopping
trip, but also these little pinpoint locations. Mission adventures can include any of the following: looking for work, performing
that work (usually a mission), pursuing a manhunt into the city, and making contact with dangerous people (a thieves guild or
assassins guild for example). Tables 1-3 through 1-9 can be very useful if the characters are looking for work.
Exploration Adventures. In this sort of adventure, the players decide to wander randomly through the city to see what
they find. It is almost impossible to plan for an adventure of this type. To prepare for an exploration adventure, it is usually best
to avoid creating pre-planned maps of anything, and to rely on random generation tables for most of the events. Running this
type of adventure requires so much creative mental activity on your part that a random generation tool is often the only way
to keep things moving at a brisk pace. Another tool for running this sort of adventure is to sketch out one or two little location-maps, just as one would for a mission adventure, but to keep them in reserve for use wherever and whenever combat actually takes place (these are often called “geomorphs”). The tables in this book can be very useful for generating the walk-through of
a city map.
Because these three types of city adventures tend to mix and blend in with each other, the tables in this section aren’t organized as a step-by-step procedure. As you design your adventure, just dip into the tables for whatever you need at the time.
