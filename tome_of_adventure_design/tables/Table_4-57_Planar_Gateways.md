Table 4-57: Planar Gateways
In addition to this table, Tables 2-56 and 2-57 can be useful for generating ideas for planar travel, and Table 3-35 offers a
variety of options for the way teleportation might work.

Festival of Cows
A toy city
Die Roll
Physical Form of Gateway (d100)
Other Aspect of Gateway (d100)
01-10
An item that is worn allows a person to shift into a
different plane. For an interesting twist, the item might
only have enough of a “charge” to allow a certain
period of time in the other plane, after which the
wearer would be pulled back into the original plane
of existence until the item has recharged and can be
used again.
Having used this particular gate as opposed to another
leaves a visible mark or aura on the characters in the
other plane. Perhaps there is a “superior” gate and an
“inferior” gate – hopefully the players picked the right
one!
11-20
Archway or other architectural feature that the
traveler walks through
Having used this particular gate, as opposed to
another, determines the physical form or abilities the
characters will have on the other side. Preferably they
picked the “Dragon” gate and not the “Mouse” gate,
for example.
21-30
Being perceived by a particular thing, whether this
is a divine being, a mirror, a monster, or an item.
Venturing into a divine grove might be perfectly safe
unless the ancient tree of skulls actually awakens and
banishes the party into the realm of ghosts…
The gateway leads to a very remote place in the
other plane (whatever that means in terms of the
physical laws of the other plane). Excellent for stealthy
operations.
31-40
Consuming some item, such as a lotus blossom
The manner in which the gateway is used actually
creates the other plane rather than simply “reaching”
it.
41-50
No physical aspect; travel to the other plane
is accomplished mentally or by use of a spell,
incantation, or similar spoken ritual. The physical
body might or might not be left behind.
Use of the gateway creates a physical effect (all the
way from a little alarm bell up to possibly a massive
earthquake) somewhere in one of the two planes.
51-60
Performing a series of acts, normally with particular
physical components such as a flint blade, a particular
incense, etc.
No particular other aspect of the gateway.

61-70
Planar relocations are the by-product of some process
that is taking place, either on this plane or on the
other. “Cosmic Drilling” in an elemental plane might
have the side effect of opening a way into the area
where the drilling is taking place.
Hundreds of

A vampire
An unreliable
information source
Much like a spider
71-80
Remaining in a particular place for a certain length
of time. In this sort of circumstance, the characters
might even “feel” themselves slowly changing their
plane of reality.
81-90
Touching a physical item such as a magical tree, an
ancient statue, or other such.
91-00
Travel is accomplished in a vehicle of some kind;
often a ship, as in Michael Moorcock’s Sailor on the Seas
of Fate.
