METHODS OF BETTING GAMES
Note that the two columns are quite similar. The idea is that unless you get a brainstorm from the combination, the second
table is what affects, activates, or represents “your turn” in the game taking place in the central feature. For example, rolling dice
might launch a ring-toss with a particular amount of strength behind the ring.
