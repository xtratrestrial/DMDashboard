DARK ANGEL (PLANAR CREATURE TYPE)
Dark angels are the tempters and plotters of demonic and fiendish realms. They have a basically human appearance, but
with one or more demonic hints. If the Dark Angel is engaged in infiltrating human society or tempting people into evil deeds, it
will likely do its best to conceal or downplay the demonic hint.
