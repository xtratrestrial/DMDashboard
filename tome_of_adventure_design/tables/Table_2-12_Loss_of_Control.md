and other dragon-like beasts. The difficulty with generating
unusual body forms for dragons is that if you get too far away
from the basic lizard-like reptile with bat wings, you start to get

monster: a single unusual physical feature, a single unusual
ability (with a sub-table for breath weapons), and the dragon’s
mentality.
