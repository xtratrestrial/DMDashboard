Table 3-113: Types of Game Series
Die Roll

01-10
11-20
As above, but the ratio of benefits to curses is higher, about 80-20. The negative effects of the curses might,
however, be greater.

Game Series (d100)
Make a list of six or ten beneficial magical conditions (Table 3-118) and curses (also Table 3-118) in a proportion
of 60-40 benefits to backfires. Each time the trick is used, roll a die to determine the effect. The effects are
“used up” once they are rolled, and if the same number is re-rolled, the result is “no effect.” A character can
only try the trick one time. A second attempt to use the trick results in a curse from Table 3-118. It is up to the
referee to determine whether the curses are minor compared to the benefits, if they are about the same scale, or
if the curses are significant and the benefits considerable.

21-30
As above, but instead of “using up” the effects, it is possible to get the same effect twice.

31-40
As above, but when an effect is used it is replaced by a (fairly minor) curse that substitutes for the original effect.
It was a terrible
idea, I admit.
41-50
As above, but instead of rolling a single die (a linear probability curve) the referee rolls 3d6 or some other
combination of dice and adds the results together. Thus, certain results are more probable than others.

51-60
Unlike the above, the game series is based on a series of die rolls, following the rules of craps (possibly disguised
in some way by an innovative referee).
61-70
Unlike the above, the game series is like a slot machine. The referee (or even the player, depending on the trick)
rolls 3d6. Each number corresponds to a picture (either little cherries or lemons like in a slot machine, or tarot
card pictures for something more sinister). Combinations of various numbers (three threes, for example) have
a certain payoff. For a game series like this, each character should only be allowed to play once, unless it costs
something to play.

Heart of the
manticore
Unlike the above, the game series might be a die roll “race,” possibly represented by little figures on a track.
The character might pull a lever and the referee rolls a die to see how far the character’s “man” moves. Then
the referee rolls for the other side. If the character gets his man to the finish line first, he gets a benefit. There
might be a backfire if he loses. Think of various carnival games for ideas on how this might look.

81-90
The character is allowed to attempt a task similar to some sort of carnival game (other than a straight-up race,
as described above). This might be a to-hit roll in an attempt to throw a ring over a prize, just like a ring toss.
The player might have choices over what to aim for, with the more desirable prizes being harder to gain. Failure
might incur a backfire – if not, there should be some cost to play, or each character should be limited to only
one attempt.
91-00
The game series might be some other sort of game, such as a card game, played in real life between the referee
and the player. These should be extremely short (rock, paper, scissors, for example), or they will bore other
players very quickly.
