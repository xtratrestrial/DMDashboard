19-21
Major hazard at a particular point, surrounded by area of high risk and reward: this might include a
“brainstone” that requires anyone within ten feet to make a saving throw or fall into babbling idiocy for several
hours – but anyone making the saving throw gains a major bonus on to-hit rolls, or can “see” what the enemy is
doing through their own eyes for several hours. Getting to it first would provide a major advantage. This sort of
tactical goal allows the players to make significant decisions that can affect the outcome in unusual ways; should
they take the risk, or not?

22-24
Major hazard at a particular point is surrounded by area of high risk, but provides a significant short cut to
movement or to a tactically beneficial location. If you’re willing to run the gauntlet, you can reap the rewards if
you survive intact enough to do so. Once again, tactics is all about maximizing player decision-making
25-27
Areas in which standard abilities do not function: dead magic, etc.
28-30
Areas in which standard abilities are weakened: ability scores, etc.
31-33
Particular weapon required, usually an odd one. This might be in a “death arena,” or a monster might have a
particular vulnerability, or a curse might make it impossible to use all non-clay weapons, or the characters might
have lost their normal weapons and are forced to improvise.
34-36
Areas in which standard abilities are altered (underwater, for example)
37-39
Areas in which potential shields rise and lower (walls, actual shields, wooden partitions, etc).
40-42
Areas which rise and sink in a predictable fashion: being in the right place at the right time gives you the
advantage of the high ground – but not forever, because the platform or whatever will sink back down again.
43-45
Areas in which shifting visual partitions close off line of sight: mists and fog banks would be an example.
46-48
Situations where unusual vehicles or modes of movement must be used: hang-gliding using huge leaves, or
teleporting from disk to disk would be examples.
49-51
Situations where the effect of movement is partially random (affected by gusting winds, tides, or small
teleportation errors, for example).
52-54
Situations where explosives can be set off (rooms with scattered barrels of flammable oil, for example). Players
love chain reactions from explosions, too.
55-57
Areas where slippery floors affect movement and/or fighting
58-60
Areas with obvious traps that could be used tactically
61-63
Areas with lots of stairs, platforms, and other features allowing three-dimensional combat tactics
Knives are out
64-66
Area containing a “victory” point; you get there, you win (or escape, depending on the situation)

67-69
Area containing things that can heal or strengthen you

Shifting gravity, areas with varying degree of gravity, or rotating environment (balconies and walls in a rotating
environment work well for changing the tactical value of the fixtures).

Area where things of tactical value appear or disappear

Areas where vision is unreliable; areas of darkness, mist, magical blindness, magic masks with no eyeholes,
hallucinations, and illusions are all examples.

Situation in which a particular code of conduct must be followed (subdue opponents only, accept surrenders,
etc.).

THE MONSTROUS ELEMENT
The actual creation of monsters is covered in chapter 2; as is their motivation, if you consider them to be a collective “villain”
and roll on the tables for villainous motivations in Book 1. Treated as a structural element in an adventure, however, the most
important “rule” is that every adventure should contain some combat elements. It might be tempting from your perspective as the referee
to create an “all traps” challenge, or an adventure pitting the characters against the elements. But your players, unless they’re an
unusual group, will want some diversity in the type of challenge their characters encounter. Single-themed adventures can get

very boring very quickly, from the perspective of the players.
Other than the fact that there should be a monstrous element, the major thing about structuring monsters into the adventure
is diversity of challenge. Vary the number and type of monsters in different encounters. An adventure in which one combat
after another is against the same type of foe, or against a single foe, is much less compelling than one in which there are several
types of monsters of varying levels of power, some alone, some in large bands.
It is not necessary to have one “boss” monster running the show, and it is not necessary to have a single monster act as the
“climax” of an adventure. However, it is a good idea to have one combat that’s abnormal, more difficult, or otherwise more
memorable than normal. A showcase, if you will. If you survey your finished adventure and find that all the encounters are
roughly of the same difficulty, or take place in nondescript rooms, or that none of them involves an interesting tactical feature,
think about adding some more spice to whichever combat has the most potential.

202 | Tome of Adventure Design (Revised) - Chapter Three
Here’s an odd tip – take it or leave it. As a matter of pacing the adventure, so that it has highs and lows, it’s my opinion that
an adventure should contain some completely mundane, average encounters. These standard-issue combats have the same

purpose as comedic breaks in a horror movie: they re-set the tension level so that the next “big” thing has more impact. As with
most things involving the monstrous element, we’re once again talking about variety and diversity. If everything is cinematic,
nothing is cinematic. If everything is special, nothing is special. A few “standard” encounters will make the unusual encounters
more memorable, somehow. It’s purely psychological; but then, so is most of adventure design.

THE MOVEMENT ELEMENT: DESIGNING THE MAP
Creating a good map is one of the most important features of designing an adventure, because the map is, effectively, the
game board for all tactical movement in the game. Always return to the fundamental question: does this map work as a game
board? Because this ultimately is the measure of a map: it is the way it will be tested, and the way in which the players will
interact with it.

TIPS ON MAP DESIGN
I can’t claim credit for all these tips; I’ve received many of them from other people:
1) A map should not be a linear pathway through the adventure. As with all things in an adventure, the key is to provide
meaningful decisions for the players to make. If your map is viewed as a flow chart, and it has no “circular” paths allowing
different ways through, then you may want to build in more choices.

2) The map should be roughly divisible into areas with only one or two ways into each area. This gives the players the
psychological reward of getting “into a new area,” and it also means that as a game board you have created a choke point for
tactical movement. The entrances and exits to areas become significant places on the board where enemies can be bottled up or
pathways can be blocked off.
3) Try thinking of the map literally as a game board with some squares labeled things like “go back two spaces,” or “you can
buy this property,” or “advance to go, collect 200gp.” Fill your mind with all the labels you’ve ever seen for game boards. Evaluate whether your map would be fun to use in a game where dice are rolled for movement and you do what it says on the various
squares. Alternatively, re-envision your map as a flow chart if that’s the way you think. Are there several different pathways
through this map?

Surrounded with
vermin
A swindler
Necromancy
Melting point

4) Use the third dimension, with up and down movement somewhere on the map.
5) Vary the physical features in various parts of the map. In dungeon adventuring this means having rooms of different sizes
and shape, corridors of different widths, and even areas with odd features like high ceilings or areas where there is flooding. In
wilderness adventures, physical features can be varied with different colors of rock, different plants or animals, different rock
formations, etc.
If you keep these five tips in mind while creating a map, you should be able to create a “flow” that maximizes the map’s tacti-

THE MISCELLANEOUS ELEMENT: CHALLENGES TO THE CHARACTER SHEET
Virtually all challenges having to do with the overall adventure should be a challenge to the intelligence and creativity of the
players at the table. However, as with most structural elements of an adventure, change-ups are required to vary the pace and

scores, and the like. Otherwise, those character sheets don’t mean much. Sometimes, traps or tricks might have a random
particular type of challenge: how to avoid being tested, or how to cope when something goes wrong. Again: the primary sort of
challenge is a test of player intelligence and skill; tests of the character sheet are the exception and the spice, not the rule or the
main dish.
