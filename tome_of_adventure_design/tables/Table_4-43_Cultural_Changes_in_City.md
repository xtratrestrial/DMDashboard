A fashion in behavior or dress becomes prevalent. Perhaps a particular type of fur is a must-have, biting a
dwarf and surviving is a status symbol, owning a pet jaguar is spiritually enlightening, etc.
11-20
A religious sect is rising rapidly in popularity. Existing, entrenched temples are forced to respond with changing
approaches and they may try to discredit or outlaw the popular movement.
21-30
A secular belief begins to spread, causing strife and intense debate. Examples might include the belief that
a minority group is inherently superior or inferior, that the common people should have rights (or that they
shouldn’t), or that certain animals are dangerous.
31-40
New form of music, poetry, art, or sculpture is considered obscene, scandalous, satirically offensive to the
nobility, irreligious, or dangerous to the established social order.
41-50
New literature or lyric forms are rediscovered by translators or imported from a foreign country. These are
considered dangerous by traditionalists and those entrenched in power based on tradition.

51-60
Political power vacuum allows a militaristic faction to increase its power without being checked by the normal
safeguards of society. This might be a militant temple, followers of a particular noble, the nobility in general,
organized crime, or demagogues.
61-70
Social change causes widespread unemployment – an influx of workers, the belief that certain forms of work
are demeaning or immoral, the rapid development of a caste system, etc).
71-80
Technological changes cause or threaten widespread unemployment (introduction of new farming techniques,
more efficient looms for weaving, or even something more fantastic, like magical sewing needles).
81-90
There is an influx of foreigners from foreign wars or famines, from movement of nomadic people, or from new
trade routes opening up. Another possibility is simply that rural peasants are moving into a city because there
are more jobs (or vice versa). The “natives” perceive economic and social risks from the foreigners, and tensions
increase, possibly to the point of new political factions and widespread violence.
91-00
Trade and crafts generate more money than farming, with the result that trade guilds and merchants begin
pushing their way into the upper classes. Traditional nobility may respond with laws or even violence against
the “upstarts.” This is also the sort of conflict that leads to the establishment of new political factions.
