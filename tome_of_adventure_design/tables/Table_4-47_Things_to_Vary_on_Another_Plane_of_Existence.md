TYPES OF PLANAR ADVENTURES
The tables here are divided up into different types of other planes of existence: Alternate Worlds/Realities, Supernatural
Planes (ghostly and wraith-like), Dimensional Planes, Spirit Planes (as in, living animal and totem spirits, not the ghosts of dead
people), Hells and Demonic Regions, Cthonic Planes (utterly alien and generally sanity-destroying), and Dream Realms.
