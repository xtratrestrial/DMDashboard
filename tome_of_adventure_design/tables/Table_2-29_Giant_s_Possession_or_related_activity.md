Keeps heads or trophies from victims
46-50
Keeps one or more maidens. Or, at least, these ladies start as maidens – some of them apparently marry the

The precise dynamic of these relationships is often left rather unclear in children’s fairy tales.

Giants are (almost) never handsome, and in most folktales they have some sort of deformity or completely inhuman feature.
Asian giants often have strangely colored skin: jet-black, yellow, red and blue, for instance.
