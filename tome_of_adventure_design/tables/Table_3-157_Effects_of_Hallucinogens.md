“Beneficial” Effect (d100)
Progressive Deteriorations (d100)
Insight; the hallucinogen functions as a lowpowered detection spell against specific hazard
such as traps, or toward a specific benefit (sensing
the presence of gold, for example)
Double-loss of the “beneficial effect.” Whatever benefit
the character gains while under the drug’s influence is
reduced below normal while the character is not under
the influence. The amount of the negative effect probably
increases over time, starting out as very minor or not even
present. That “not even present” possibility could make a
character repeatedly drink from a supply of “potions” that
are actually an addictive hallucinogen.
Attribute Gain: while the character is under the
influence of the drug, some attribute score is
increased to the point where it creates a bonus or
other benefit

Evidence of magic

Frequent and increasing need for sleep affects normal
performance as a character if it isn’t met.

Hit point gain: while the character is under the
influence of the drug, he or she is capable of
taking more damage than normal.
Increasing episodes of confusion, possibly to the point
where a spell caster cannot always succeed at casting a
spell, or a fighter cannot reliably make attacks in any
particular combat round.
76-00
Berserk attacks or a “danger sense” that gives the
character some sort of benefit in combat – some
of these might also have a negative effect: berserk
attacking usually makes the character easier to
hit as well as being able to hit more effectively.
Deteriorating senses: character is becoming less able to see
things clearly, for example, starting the process of getting
penalties to attack rolls, etc.
