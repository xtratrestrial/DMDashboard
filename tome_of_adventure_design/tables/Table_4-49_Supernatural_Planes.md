Table 4-49: Supernatural Planes
Die Roll
01-10

Certain terrible events might “replay themselves,” causing danger to those who are caught up in the echo –
which, to them, would effectively be truly happening.
11-20
Despair, greed, rage, or other mental state creeps up on characters if they fail periodic saving throws
21-30
Each encounter with beings in the plane involves a test of wills, with failure indicating that the loser has come, to
some degree or other, under the control of the other creature. The characters might have an item that lets them
do the same thing, too – building up an army of ghouls as they approach the King Wraith’s vast castle…
31-40
Effect on healing or other beneficial clerical-type spells. If the plane’s ghostly powers are antithetical to certain
religious powers, those powers might be weakened in the other plane of existence.
41-50
Material plane is visible, but there is a constant risk of becoming separated from it (either a flat probability
checked at intervals, or actions create a risk of separation to some increasing degree)
51-60
Places may have “echo” powers – one of the main concepts of a supernatural plane is ghostliness, and places
exert compelling powers in many ghost stories.
61-70
Presence of an undead type that is not ordinarily found in material planes (see Tables 2-64 through 2-68 for
ideas)
71-80
Presence of one normal, living species that one would not expect to find here. For instance, a wraith world
where normal, living wolves are found. Or small frogs. Any possibility is a bit spooky; the animals might be
helpful, hostile, or just part of the weirdness of the scenery.
81-90
Risk of becoming possessed – although possession is often associated with demons, it’s a good ghostly risk as
well. Thinking up some unusual characteristic of ghostly possession would add a great deal of spice to the
“flavor” of the plane.
91-00
Visitors dying in the plane will have their souls trapped there
