Comet Cycles
The appearance of certain predictable comets in the night sky is often given mystical
significance. Comet-cycles can be a great adventure-generating device because of
the long intervals between the comet’s appearances. Lots of unpredictable things
can happen to places, societies, and collective memory while the comet is away. For
example: if some form of lycanthropy is linked to the appearance of a comet rather
than a full moon, the lycanthropic disease might be transmitted far and wide while
dormant, then suddenly appear all over the place when the comet appears in the sky. It
would become a sort of celestial retro-virus.

Fashion Cycles
Freezing/Thawing
Cycle
Lunar Cycle
A cycle might be derived from the operation of a device that divides time into a regular
or irregular pattern. For instance, if the cycle is determined by the burning of candles
without regard to the length of the candle, the cycle would be irregular. If the candles
were scrupulously measured to be identical, the candle-driven cycle would be regular.
Devices to measure out time could involve dripping water, candles, hourglasses, water
wheels, gears, and many other mechanical arrangements.
A solstice is one of the two times of year when the sun is farthest off the celestial
equator. These occur at approximately June 22 (the summer solstice) and December
22 (the winter solstice). Summer solstice is the shortest night of the year, and winter
solstice is the longest night. The equinox is when the sun crosses the equator and days
and nights are of closest to equal length. The equinoxes occur at approximately March
21 (the Vernal Equinox, also the first day of Spring) and September 23 (the Autumnal
Equinox). Note that Autumn and Spring are reversed for the northern and southern
hemispheres of the earth.
The types of clothes and the jewelry people wear comes into and out of fashion
periodically, as do haircuts, luxury commodities, philosophies, and religious practices.
Magical effects like planar gates could easily be influenced by fashions in behavior or
religion. It might be, for example, that a planar gate opens only when a local god has
a minimum number of worshippers present at a significant ritual. When it becomes
more fashionable for people to worship that god, the chance of the gate opening would
suddenly increase.
A particular cycle for a villain’s activities, or the opening of some sort of portal or
dungeon entrance, could be linked to the seasonal freezing and thawing of a barrier
that blocks the portal, or of a mechanism that controls it. The builder might have
intended the cycle of freezing and thawing, or the seasons might have changed since
the original construction. Freezing and thawing also affect the volume of water moving
in rivers, and patterns of migration by animals. This is a time cycle that can be used to
drive a wide variety of adventures and monsters.
Earth’s lunar cycle from new moon to new moon is 29.5 days, and is called the Synodic
Lunar Cycle. Measuring the lunar cycle based on when the moon arrives in the same
place in the sky (regardless of phase) is called the Sidereal Cycle and is 27.1 days in
length. For gaming purposes, the “average” lunar cycle of 28 days is probably close
enough unless the adventure is deeply involved in astrology. The phases of the moon
are: new moon, crescent moon, first quarter moon, waxing gibbous moon, full moon,
waning gibbous moon, last quarter moon, crescent moon, and then new moon again.
The cycle of lunar eclipses is also an excellent fantasy theme, although the cycle of an
eclipse is much longer than the cycle of the lunar phases.

Morphological
Life Cycle
(one creature)
Some creatures have a life cycle in which their form changes radically; butterflies begin
as caterpillars, frogs begin as tadpoles, many insects go through a pupae or larval
stage. Although this is related to the reproductive cycle of the species, the radical
morphological changes allow these creatures to have the right body-form for the right
purpose at the right time. The caterpillar form, for example, is well adapted to eating
huge quantities of food, whereas the mobility of the butterfly stage allows for finding
stronger mates more easily. Intelligent creatures with morphological cycles might open
and close portals (or be able to, based on their current phase). For example, a gate
might remain closed while eggs gestate in some bizarre inter-dimensional space, or be
opened when the creatures are in a predatory body-form and then close again. Only
the strong and well fed predators would make it back to the gate, and would then be
all together within the gate for the mating cycle to begin. The possible variations on
this pattern are quite numerous. If a villain is acting according to such a life cycle, it’s
not necessarily because the villain is one of the morphologically shifting creatures. It
might be that the villain knows how to take advantage of the changing life forms of the
creatures, or that he’s allied to them but can only take advantage of the alliance when
the creatures are in an intelligent form, a dangerous form, a magically powerful form,
or what have you. Again, the possibilities are vast.
(series of creatures)
Just as a particular life form may go through radical morphological changes in order
to link up form with function in a series of steps, it is also possible for a species to
generate a sequence of life forms, only one of which is the breeder. As an example,
envision a life form whose “queen” and “drone” eggs stay dormant for a long period
of time, and need to be shifted from a hot incubation environment to a colder hatching
environment. One “generation” of workers is a hot-weather creature that cares for
the eggs during the incubation phase. As the incubation phase ends, the worker mate
among themselves, producing an entirely different form – a flying form well suited
for migration. The flying forms transport the eggs to a colder climate in a migration,
breed again to create a cold-weather worker caste, and then die. The cold-weather
caste hatches rapidly in the cold, and these workers care for the queen and drone eggs.
The queens and drones fly back to the hot-weather area to breed and lay eggs of three
kinds: queens, drones, and more hot-weather workers. The hot-weather workers hatch
quickly to care for the new queen and drone eggs, and the cycle begins again. At some
point in such a cycle, it might be that the door to underground hatching chambers must
be unsealed, or the migration might take place across different planes of existence,
requiring the temporary opening of planar gates. A villain’s motivation in all this could
be of many different kinds: he might be intercepting the migrations, stealing eggs, using
the unique capabilities of one of the life forms in an alliance, etc.
Planetary Cycles
The proximity of particular planets to the Earth, or their location within a region
of the sky (particularly a zodiacal region) can be a usable cycle for the purposes of a
fantasy world, possibly having effects on magic, on different kinds of magic, villain
motivations, and the opening or closing of planar gates or dungeon entrances.
Reproductive Cycle
The average human menstrual cycle is 28 days. If the villainess is non-human, the
cycle might not be a menstrual cycle, but a cycle of being “in heat” or “in season.”
This same pattern might apply to unusual monsters as well as non-human animals.
Female dogs stay in heat for about 21-28 days depending on breed (as one example of
a heat cycle). Note: the cycle of a male villain’s activity might be linked to someone
else’s reproductive cycle. The purpose of a dungeon or planar gate that opens and
seals based on the reproductive cycle of a tribe or being is fairly obvious, and could
(ahem) give birth to interesting adventure scenarios.

Rising and Falling
Magical Power
The lunar, menstrual, and solar cycles are all associated with the rise and fall of
magical capabilities, but a fantasy world may have an independent cycle of rising a
falling magical power, not marked by these factors. Fluctuations in magic power might
be druidic (some fluctuation in the earth’s spiritual nature), might be related to arcane
magic (a fluctuation in the eldritch energy that can be tapped by spells) or might be
related to a fluctuation in divine power (possibly related to planar “distance, a period
of dormancy, or divine battles that occupy the attention of the gods from time to time).
A wizard’s personal capability might be linked to the concept of “mana,” personal
reserves of magical power that might shift with the tides of time. Monsters might also
feel the effects of magical change.
Scriptural Cycle
Secondary Effect
Temperature Cycles
Traumatic Stress
In Judaism, the Torah (that’s the five books of Moses, in case you’re not familiar) is
divided into parshas (segments) one of which is read and studied each seven days. The
parshas correspond to the Jewish lunar calendar, so that the same parsha is read at the
same lunar date every year. The point of completion of the reading, when the Torah
scroll is rolled back to the beginning is a major holiday, as is the middle of the Torah
(the day of atonement) and the reading on the new year (which precedes the day of
atonement by a week). A religious scripture in a fantasy world might also follow a cycle
not related to the calendar – planar gates or subterranean chambers might be opened
(or open of their own accord) in a cycle driven by the reading of scriptures instead
of a calendar cycle. The reading itself might trigger these events, rather than merely
corresponding to them.
Any of the various cycles listed in this table might be the cause of some other
secondary effect that normally (but does not always) result from the primary cycle. For
instance, the hatching patterns of locusts often (but does not always) cause famines.
The focus of your adventure might not be the locust hatching, but the resulting famine.
The periodic flooding of the Nile river was necessary to good harvests in Ancient
Egypt; when that cycle failed due to low rainfall in the African interior, famines and
food shortages resulted in Egypt. Adventures premised upon the secondary effects
of a primary cycle might focus on the times when the expected result (the flooding of
the Nile, or a locust plague) doesn’t take place. Why didn’t it? The answer might be
valuable, crucial, or financially rewarding.
Variations in temperature can cause all sorts of varying human behaviors, cause
changes in economic factors, and can also trigger certain events in the animal and plant
kingdoms. Consider such things as a locust-like insect with eggs that lie dormant until
particularly hot temperatures arrive. In a completely different sort of example, consider
than a villain’s opportunities for villainy might be considerably enhanced if the local
community is snowbound, huddled up in cottages instead of wandering about the
village with prying eyes that might see what he’s doing…
Individuals who have suffered traumatic stress may re-live the event or its emotional
impact, and this often happens on or around the anniversary of the event. The cycle
could also be based on any cycle of events that either symbolize or reproduce the
conditions and setting of the traumatic event. A fantasy world might have an analogue,
in other words, to the way many combat veterans react to the sound of helicopters
and/or fireworks.

M. REPUTATION
The villain is trying to manipulate his own or another person’s reputation, either as an invincible villain or as a good person
(which would be an infiltration tactic). Table 1-30 determines whose reputation is to be improved or faked, and Table 1-31 indicates the nature and method of the manipulation.
