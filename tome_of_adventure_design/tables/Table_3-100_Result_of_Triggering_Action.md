Emits Warning Signal and then activates some sort of interesting attack, which can be turned off. When the
attack is turned off, the trick gives out a benefit of some kind. The benefit might go only to the person who
turned off the attack, or might be given to everyone. Note that if the “Warning Signal” was hitting the party
with some sort of sucker-punch, the sucker-punch is probably a way of making the party (or certain members)
more vulnerable to the interesting attack. Example of this: when the party triggers the trick, it does two things;
the first is to cast a paralysis spell (which might take down some of the party members) and then open up a
chute full of giant ants. If you’ve got someone who can fight through to the chute and close it, you can cut off
the supply of ants. Instead of paralysis, maybe the trick spat globs of honey before opening the ant-chute.
11-20
Emits Warning Signal and then offers a Choice (see Table 3-110). Each party member (or a random party
member, or certain party members) gets to pick something. Whether or not you get to play might depend on
your response to the warning signal or whether you were involved in triggering the trick in the first place.
21-30
Emits Warning Signal and then offers to answer questions (or otherwise gives out useful information). There
might be a price for answering the questions, and the thing might not mention the price ahead of time.
31-40
Emits Warning Signal and then provides a benefit of some kind. However, if the party doesn’t then provide a
Correct Response (Table 3-102), the benefit will be taken away again, reverse itself into a curse, or otherwise
elicit a bad response.
41-50
Emits Warning Signal and then waits for a Correct Response (Table 3-102). It probably gives a clue of some
sort about what that action is, either by speaking, mental communication, revealing something written, making
a gesture, etc. If the Correct Response is not taken (within some period of time), the Thing confers a curse,
mental disability, a physical disability, or steals stuff (see Table 3-118 and following tables for ideas). If the
Correct Response is made, the thing confers a beneficial magical condition (see Table 3-118 for this, also).
51-60
Emits Warning Signal, and waits a moment. Everyone standing in the right place (however that is determined)
gets a beneficial magical condition (Table 3-118). Everyone standing in the wrong place gets a curse (Table
3-118). In some cases, there might also be neutral areas where the trick does nothing.
61-70
The Thing asks a question and waits for the right answer. Giving the right answer gets you a beneficial magical
condition (3-118). Giving the wrong answer gets you a curse (3-118). In some cases, you might be allowed more
than one wrong answer before getting hit for it. If more than one wrong answer is permitted, There might be
some indication of how many more are left. This might be, for example, a rising water level, a statue holding up
one finger to indicate the wrong answer, a statue putting down one of three fingers to indicate that one of the
three wrong answers has been used, etc. The question might be an interrogation about the party’s intentions,
might be a riddle, or might be about a fact somewhere in the dungeon (“What does the giant statue in the lava
pool look like?”).
71-80
The Thing offers a game, or sets a game in motion (shift over to Game Tricks: see Table 3-108 and following
tables)
81-90
The Thing offers advice. This might be the end of the show, the main benefit of the trick. The advice might
be vague, might be a poem, might be a riddle, etc. On the other hand, it might be crucial whether the party
follows the advice … if the advice is “take a duck,” and there’s a table full of rubber duckies, the party might be
surprised when the giant axe sweeps through the room at neck level (i.e., you were supposed to duck your head).
Often, however, the advice will be about how to get through an architectural trick to a treasure, or what the
name of the demon in room 17 is, or which of the two doors to take.
91-00
The Thing provides the ingredients for an Experiment Trick (shift over to Experiment Tricks starting with Table
3-87).

WARNING SIGNALS
Links of grass
A warning signal is basically a way of alerting the players that the trick’s status has changed. It has woken up, been activated,
gotten annoyed, changed personalities, received a right answer, received a wrong answer, etc.
