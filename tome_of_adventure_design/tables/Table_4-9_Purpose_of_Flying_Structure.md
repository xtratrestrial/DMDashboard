CASTLES AND RUINS
Castles and ruins will generally be used quite differently from each other in adventures, since castles are occupied (political or
assault-on-occupied-location types of adventures) and ruins are mainly abandoned (explore-and-loot types of adventures). However, for purposes of getting ideas, castles and ruins are very similar. Both involve open-air adventuring with a possible aerial
component, and the background and physical design of the adventure locale is a very similar process – since ruins are usually the
broken and abandoned form of a castle-like settlement.
