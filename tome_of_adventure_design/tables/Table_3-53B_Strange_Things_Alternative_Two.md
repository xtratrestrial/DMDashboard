SPECIAL ROOMS
Special Rooms are simply the rooms with more detail to them than just monsters, treasure, and/or bits of dungeon dressing. They don’t have to be super-dramatic (that’s more the role of Big Things and Strange Things), but they should generally
be interactive or provide information, one or the other. In some cases they might incorporate tricks or traps, but beware – you
don’t want to make every interesting room contain something dangerous, or the players will eventually assume that every room
containing more detail than a broken arrow on the floor is a risk. Leave many of these rooms to be nothing more than … interesting.
