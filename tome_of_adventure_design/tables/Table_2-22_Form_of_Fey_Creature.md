FEY CONTRACTS
It is a constantly recurring theme in folklore that the wee folk and other nature spirits can be forced to serve or to give up treasure if the right bargain is struck or the right commands invoked. In this way, the fey folk are much like genies and elementals
(and the following table is accordingly similar to Table 2-16).
