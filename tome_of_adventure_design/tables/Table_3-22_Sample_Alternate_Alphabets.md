There are a vast number of fantasy fonts available on the Internet that can serve as a code alphabet. The Autorealm Phoenician font used in the above table is one of these, taken from the Autorealm mapping site. Hieroglyph fonts, Hebrew, and pictograms are also good if you don’t want to provide any clues by using letters with similarities to their modern equivalents. Script
fonts that connect letters are much harder to decipher, since the players won’t know where one letter ends and another begins, so I
don’t recommend these.
Many player will be aware that “e” is the most commonly used letter in the English language, since this knowledge was well
disseminated in the Sherlock Holmes story, “The Dancing Men.” Making the letter “e” recognizable will go a long way toward

players to figure out. It is good planning to have the solution available somewhere else in the adventure, and NEVER make
solving a riddle the only way for the players to proceed all the way through an adventure.
The easiest way to create a riddle is to follow the steps below:
Start with the answer you want, such as, “horse.”
Jot down the distinctive characteristics of the thing you’ve chosen as the riddle’s answer. A horse, for example, has four legs, a
mane, a tail, carries a rider, has hoofs, etc. This is a brainstorming step; write down everything you can think of.
Consider ways of describing these characteristics in a vague or poetic manner. For example, a horse is a land-strider. Because
a person sits on it, it can be “man’s throne.” And its iron-shod feet make sparks when they strike stone. Thus, “Land strider,
man’s throne, sparks fly when I step to stone.”
Take a shot at putting a rhyme or two into the riddle. It’s not necessary, but the impact is far better.

THE MAP
INTRODUCTION
The various sections of this part of the book are organized in the context of a random dungeon generator, but they are actually intended to be used separately, when you are looking for a bit of specific inspiration about some feature in a dungeon you
aren’t generating randomly. The other possible way of organizing them was alphabetically, and I decided that as a creative tool,

it would be better to provide some connection between the elements instead of presenting them in isolation. Even if the designer
is initially looking for an isolated element, the connections themselves might serve as an independent source of inspiration.
QUICK INSPIRATION
If what you’re looking for is just a quick inspiration for “what comes next” in an existing dungeon, it’s a bit irritating to be

faced with an entire dungeon-generation system. There are a couple of quick ways to get ideas for “what comes next.”
Starting wherever you need some inspiration (the edge of your existing map), and go directly to Table 3-23 to generate ideas
for the transition into a new area. Once that’s done, go to Table 3-37 to see what’s on the other side of the transition area. Table
3-37 generates the general layout of a set of rooms and chambers, and can be used to generate the shape and sizes of those
areas.
Another possibility is to jump all the way down to Tables 3-78 and 3-79 and see which one of them you like best (these two
tables are similar but alternate methods). Table 3-78 offers general ideas for what might come next in a dungeon, without many
references to the tables. Table 3-79, on the other hand, is designed to direct you back into the tables – it is like a master table for

jumping randomly into the tables. In other words, Table 3-78 is for use if you’re feeling pretty creative, and Table 3-79 is for use
if you want to treat this whole section as a grab-bag of tables instead of a step-by-step process.
The third alternative is just to browse through the tables until something catches your eye as an interesting idea.

HOLISTIC DUNGEON GENERATION
Every method I have seen for generating random dungeon maps is a linear “walk” through the dungeon’s passageways, with

if you’re pressed for time, and it can certainly provide you with flashes of inspiration. There is, however, a somewhat better way
means you won’t have to erase big parts of the map as often as you do when using a linear generator. At its best, it allows you
as the dungeon designer to integrate your own creative processes more easily into the overall pattern of random results as that
pattern develops.
THE CONCEPT OF DUNGEON AREAS
A dungeon “area” is a set of rooms (or chambers, or caverns) that are separated from other groups by only one or two connections. In other words, the dungeon map is “granular,” made up of distinct pieces. There are several reasons for constructing
a dungeon map in this fashion: the small number of connections makes each one tactically important for escape route and
ambushes, and because the areas are segmented, the players themselves gain a sense of excitement when they realize they have

discovered a new area of the dungeon. The dungeon level has regions, rather than being a single, undifferentiated whole.
Perhaps as importantly, dividing the dungeon map into such segments allows you, as the designer, to apply your different
creative inspirations in small bites. It is much easier to work several different ideas into a dungeon level when there are naturally
existing borders to separate one idea from the next.

ARRANGING THE AREAS
A mistake in the
formula
The first step in designing a dungeon holistically is to create the arrangement of the areas (groups of rooms) and their connections.
The dungeon is divided into areas, and each area is connected to others by a “transition.” Choose an arrangement of the areas from the options below. The lines are the transition areas, the square box is the starting area, and the circles are areas found
beyond the starting area. It is a good idea to sketch the resulting diagram (or one you create) onto a full sized sheet of paper,
because you will probably be writing notes about each circle and line before you move on to creating a real map.

TRANSITIONS BETWEEN DUNGEON AREAS (THE CONNECTING LINES)
Each line on the dungeon’s chart of areas is a “transition,” that can be as simple as a door or as bizarre as a teleportation
device. Roll for each transition line on your chart, determine if there is a trick associated with it, and note that all down next to
the line.
