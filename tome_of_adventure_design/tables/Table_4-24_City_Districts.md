City Districts (d100)
Segregated: not necessarily indicating poverty, a segregated district is an area where members of a specific caste,
species, nationality, social status, occupation, or religion are concentrated. Laws in particularly oppressive cities
might require this sort of segregation, or it might simply be that members of the group prefer to self-segregate,
gravitating to the same neighborhoods out of choice. In particular, foreigners who speak a different language
than the predominant one will frequently congregate in one area.
11-20
Guild Quarter: Craftsmen often gather together in particular areas, and sometimes the guilds will cooperate to
hire private watchmen and guards for this area
21-30
Merchants’ Quarter

Poor Quarter/Slums

Red Light District: Whether it’s geisha houses or dilapidated brothels, the world’s oldest profession is often
segregated into a specific neighborhood

Slaughterhouse District: Many cities isolated businesses that produced bad smells, such as tanneries,
slaughterhouses, stables, and cattle pens. Such districts might also contain the residences of the city’s poorer
inhabitants
61-70
Temple District: An area dominated by temples and the housing of priests.
71-80
Thieves’ Quarter: Few cities would have a quarter specifically devoted to the profession of larceny, but some
poorer quarters might be dominated by organized crime and become known for it. Such quarters often form
where part of the city is self-governed or subject to less onerous laws. Interestingly, theaters were often also
found in such districts.
81-90
Wealthy or Nobles’ District: such districts will contain partially fortified houses and even small estates, villas, or
compounds comprising several buildings. Many of the families living in these areas will have troops or retainers,
or at the very least a couple of private guardsmen.
91-00
Wharfs/Docks: Fishermen and sailors, together with businesses catering to them.
