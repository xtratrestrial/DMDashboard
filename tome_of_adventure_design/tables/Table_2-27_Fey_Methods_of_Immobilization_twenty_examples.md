Table 2-27: Fey Methods of Immobilization (twenty examples)
Die Roll

Method of Immobilization
01-05
Affect ground or rock, causing it to grab or even entomb enemies
06-10
Breathe out magic breath, which freezes using cold temperature or simply paralyzes opponents magically
11-15
Cause all of enemies’ actions to take the opposite effect (raising arm actually lowers it, a step forward takes
a step back, etc). This might be overcome, but trying to work everything in reverse would cause incredible
clumsiness.
16-20
Cause enemies to become so enraged that they hack away at the ground, each other, and anything else other
than the fey creature.
Pattern of

Unstable
protective wards
21-25

A characteristic of

26-30
Cause enemies to follow a glowing light or summoned animal, away from the fey creature or into peril
Swore fealty
31-35
Cause enemies to listen to a particular sound, enraptured

SUMMONING FEY CREATURES
Many fey creatures are subject to being summoned or called from their homes to assist the summoner. In general, some kind
of bargain needs to be struck, but the bargain could potentially already exist, or have been negotiated ahead of time. Since lots
of these methods involve some kind of speech, the required speech might include the offered terms of the bargain, which might
influence the success of the summoning/calling.
