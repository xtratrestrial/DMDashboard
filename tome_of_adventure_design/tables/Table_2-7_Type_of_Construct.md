Type of Construct
Comments
Elemental-animated or spiritanimated machine or object
An elemental creature or a creature from the spirit-world has been
bound into the object, machine, or structure as the force that animates
it. The imprisoned/bound creature provides the object with whatever
intelligence or cunning it possesses.
Heretical machine
Magically animated object in its
natural shape
Animated chairs, tables, catapults, etc.
Shadow vessel
Restless inquiry
Magically Augmented Machine
A machine that doesn’t operate purely by means of technology, and may
not include any mechanical components at all other than hinges and
bolts. A basic example is an iron cobra with no inner mechanisms – it
is an object specifically designed to be animated. On the more complex
side of the spectrum might be a huge lobster-shaped battle robot
powered by magical pistons and gears, but with no magic animating the
mechanisms driven by those pistons and gears.
Spirit-animated substance, in a
prepared shape
This includes the classic man-shaped golem, but could be any shape. A
spirit could be imprisoned in a garbage pile, and then you’d have an
animated garbage-pile.
True Machine
This is either a machine with some sort of artificial brain, or a machine
with no intelligence whatsoever.
PHYSICAL DANGER POSED BY CONSTRUCT
It’s easiest to start creating a construct by focusing on what sort of risk it poses to the adventurers. This list of physical dangers constructs can cause is more focused than the larger tables of physical attacks (Table 2-64), and may be a better starting
point. After getting a general picture of the construct’s physical threat, and if the construct is more than just a physical monster,
roll on the large table of special attacks (Table 2-71).
