TRAPS, GENERALLY
Dream of a Dead
Man
Traps are divided into basic traps, which usually offer a
single type of risk, and complex traps, which involve more
than just the “trigger + result” profile of a basic trap. Basic
mechanical traps, without any sort of complicated trigger,
are the classic “hallway traps.” When they are concealed in
items or have complicated triggers, basic mechanical traps
are the staple form of a “room trap.” Rigged natural features
(a basic trap), and all complex traps, are more unusual – but
they can be some of the most memorable parts of a dungeon
level as long as they aren’t overused. Too many traps can spoil
a dungeon adventure by slowing the characters (and the pace
