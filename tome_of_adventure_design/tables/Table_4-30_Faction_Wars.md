ABSTRACT CITY-ENCOUNTER GENERATOR
This generator is much too open-ended for use at the gaming table, but it can be useful for designing your own city encounter tables, if thatâ€™s the way you want to handle running your city. The table defines the basic outline of the encounter in broad
parameters, which can then be fleshed out.
