Intended Method of Destruction (d100)
01-05
Anger the Protector. The plan is to cause the community’s destruction by getting a significant protector of
the village to depart, leaving the community at the mercy of predators (including the villain). The protector
might be a knight, a powerful cleric, or some other person. The methods might include framing this protector
for crimes, spreading rumors about him, or impersonating him while committing crimes. Virtually any sort of
activity designed to besmirch a person’s reputation might be used.
06-10
Arson. The villain plans to burn everything to the ground, either directly or with the help of a firebug minion.
11-15
Attack! The villain has enough military resources to attack and destroy the community – possibly missing just
one key factor.
16-20
Eviction. The villain is (legally) evicting members of the community by using his influence with the legal
system, influence with rulers, false facts, framed evidence of crimes, diverting taxes from reaching tax collectors,
etc. This is the “evil landlord” type of villain who makes an appearance in many of the Brothers Grimm fairy
tales.
21-25
26-30
Harbor the Menace. The villain plans to (or has already started to) provide a safe lair for a predatory killer,
monster, murderer, trapper, arsonist, etc. The dangerous inhabitant might have been brought in, found and
adopted, or actually created by the villain.
Interdiction or Siege. This sort of plot could include any sort of interdiction of supply or demand. The
“standard” use of this plot as an adventure device is a military blockade or siege; bandits cutting off the road
to a village, or the siege of a fortification. However, there are many subtler ways to use this sort of plot as well.
Blessings or information might be the “commodity” that’s being cut off rather than the more obvious food and
trade. The villain might, for example, have manipulated the local high priest into refusing to perform religious
ceremonies, or might have captured him. The interdiction might be limited to a particular commodity, such
as the iron needed for a blacksmithing operation in a local castle. Causing the iron to rust while it’s in transit
is an example of interdiction bearing no resemblance to a straightforward siege. Let your mind roam free for
possibilities – this is a plot with lots of scope for GM creativity.

31-35
Murder. The villain (or a deadly minion) is killing the community one at a time, the old fashioned way. This
could be a straightforward psycho killer or other human-hater on the loose, or it could be a much more intricate
plot: watch Tim Burton’s film version of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (the one with Johnny Depp) for a really
complex example.
36-40
Plague. The villain plans to spread a plague, or is somehow maintaining an existing plague. This might
be done with mundane means such as putting rotting meat into a water supply, it might be a magical plague
maintained with the help of a god of disease, or it might be a magic-user casting uniquely-crafted spells.
41-45
Poison. The villain is poisoning something: water, food, air, animals, crops, clothing, etc.
46-50
Prepare for Battle. The villain is hiring or assembling troops (possibly monstrous) for a direct military
assault. The troops might not yet be well enough trained, or might not be numerous enough for the invasion to
begin.
51-55
Provoke Invasion by Impersonation. The villain seeks to provoke someone else into invading the
community. He is doing so by impersonating members of the community while committing crimes, treason,
immoral acts, etc. This could be as large-scale as committing raids against one baron’s villages under the flag of
another baron.
56-60
Provoke Invasion by Lies. The villain seeks to provoke an invasion by spreading rumors and lies about the
community (e.g., the village is a hideout for bandits, a guild is plotting the overthrow of the king, a village is
harboring a traitor, etc.).
61-65
Remove Skilled Leader. The villain wants to remove a skilled leader – not a protector, but someone whose
services are vital to the community. Examples might include a well-known swordsmith, a druid who blesses
the crops, or someone who gives wise counsel. The means of removal might include violence, provoking the
community to exile the leader, or poisoning the leader’s opinion of the community.
66-70
Remove/Destroy Protective Item. The villain’s target is some item that protects the community; he plans
to steal it, destroy it, or nullify its effects.
71-75
Sabotage Source of Income. The villain has a cunning plan to destroy the market for the community’s
product. He might plan to poison the product, sabotage its quality, spread rumors about it, etc.
76-80
Sabotage the Food Source. The villain is eliminating domestic animals or crops, possibly by poison, possibly
by slaughter, or perhaps by theft. He might be calling in predators using some magical capability.
81-85
Smuggle in Beasts. The villain is in the process of enticing, luring, or importing monsters into the area. This
could be a plot involving changelings, shape-shifters, or some other subtlety – or it might be that the villain’s
making a dragon-calling whistle.
86-90
Spread Dissention. The villain plans to set members of the community violently against each other by
spreading lies and rumors. This is the Iago-type villain of Shakespeare’s Othello, who puts the right word in the
right ear, spreading hatred and distrust where there was originally friendship and mutual alliance.
91-95
Traps. The villain is setting traps around or in the community. His intention might be to kidnap, or the traps
might be lethal.
96-00
Wild West Chaos. The villain is engaging in widespread robbery and burglary, probably with the help of
minions. Here, the villain’s goal is either to take control of the community when law and order break down, or
simply to bleed it dry in an orgy of violence and theft.
