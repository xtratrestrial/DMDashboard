Wall(s) moves to block exit
Walls move to divide up the area
Paralyzing

Thorns or plants grow or
move to block exit
Thorns or plants grow in the trap area
to divide party and possibly immobilize
some of them by entangling
Grabbing (bear traps, magical
arms, tentacles, etc.)
25-32
Wall of fire, ice, or wind, or a
body of water, forms behind
the party
Fire or ice forms to physically divide
the party from each other. Damage is
possible.
Transformation-type attack
(stone to flesh beams, etc.)
33-40
Snakes, insects, or monster
appear behind party to block
off exit
Bars, grates, or portcullises emerge or
fall in a pattern intended to separate
party members from each other
Adhesives
41-48
Bars, grates, or portcullises
trap the entire party in an
area
Ropes or chains emerge to separate
party members
Cage(s) fall, rise, or form,
attempting to capture
individuals
49-56
Party is shifted into a
dimensional pocket
Certain party members are trapped in
different time-speeds, caught in other
dimensions (although still visible), or
stasis fields separate the party.
Pits open to catch individual
Dangerous glyphs form
behind party, or the thing they
are written upon is physically
moved behind party
Force fields separate party members
(walls, globes, etc.)
Ice, glass, Lucite, plaster,
amber, hardening mud,
rapidly-solidifying stone or
resin is used in an attempt to
immobilize some or all party
members
66-74
Force field forms behind party
Beams or rays of magical power
separate the party, and are the
equivalent of an electrical fence if
touched (paralysis or damage being the
most obvious results, although the field
is open for weirder beams)
Mental inability to move
(confusion, rage, fear) is
directed at party
75-83
Frictionless or greased
surfaces make escape very
hard (probably a slope or cliff
is involved as well)
Party members shrink in size and are
now separated by great distances.
Alternatively, some dimensional effect
causes a fake distance effect between
them
Certain party members are
trapped in different timespeeds, caught in other
dimensions (although still
visible), or stasis fields separate
the party.

Party is swallowed by something
(architectural, demonic, or even
animal). Alternatively, powerful
monsters (or even invulnerable
ones) that don’t attack (probably
constructs, elementals, or
undead) move to guard the exit.
They might respond if pushed;
this isn’t as unfair as it sounds –
remember, they are serving as
a wall, and walls are essentially
invulnerable, too.
Powerful monsters emerge and push the
party members into cells (or something
equivalent), then leave. It’s possible but
highly unlikely the party can beat them,
but the monsters don’t actually attack,
either. Undead or constructed monsters
work best for this. The other possibility
is a virtually unbeatable horde of lesser
monsters that also don’t actually attack,
just put the party into the cells.
Party is turned into gas and
sucked through small opening
(probably reconstituting on the
other side)
Bars, grates, or portcullises emerge or fall
in a pattern intended to separate party
members from each other
