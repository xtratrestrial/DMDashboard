CATEGORIES OF DIFFERENT RESULTS (EXPLANATIONS)

Transmutation: Something or someone is, or can be, changed as a result of the experiment.
A contraption of
some kind
Processing: Something is developed or manipulated, and this changes something else. Much like a transmutation, but it is

indirect. For example, a character might get processed into fuel for something else. Or, the charcoal you feed into the statue’s
mouth might be turned into the key for a door. This is a two-step process rather than a one-step process.
Movements or Access: Successfully conducting the experiment opens a door, allows you to get through something, or gives
you something you can use to get through something.
Conditions and Curses: Instead of actually being changed, your condition changes. For example, you might get blessed,
cursed, diseased, cured, healed, electrically charged, able to fly, or crushed. There are many possibilities.
Generation or Genesis: The combination of the trick’s two elements creates something. This might be a useful or harmful
substance, it might be a dimensional gateway, it might be a key or other useful item.
