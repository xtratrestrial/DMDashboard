FEY CREATURES
Lawyer
The concept of a fey creature is a gamer-created mishmash of virtually all folkloric creatures that don’t eat humans, aren’t
of godlike power, aren’t significantly larger than humans, are corporeal, and are basically of a human body type. The gamer
model of fey creatures relies most heavily on the sidhe (Ireland) and the wee folk (Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Bretagne) mixed in
with corporeal nature-spirits from numerous other cultures (the nymphs and dryads of Ancient Greek mythology being a prime
example). These tables essentially retro-engineer the artificial category of “Fey” by returning to the folkloric sources of the

creatures commonly labeled as being in the category, drawing out resemblances and common features. That being said, there is
a general set of folkloric characteristics attributed to the traditional creatures of the “fey” category:
1. They are associated with nature and the wilderness, and often tied to a specific place in the wilderness such as a
tree or river;
2. They are difficult to find when sought – often because they inhabit a sort of magically hidden “otherworld,” can

3. Most are extremely cunning, but vulnerable to trickery due to their extreme pride or greed (generally for food or
gold);
4. They show virtually no compassion for human beings, with the exception of Victorian England’s tiny fairies with
their butterfly wings and flower-dwellings;
5. They are corporeal;
6. They are frequently (but not always) associated with magical items;
7. They are frequently associated with transformations of themselves or those who anger them;
8. They are, almost universally, absolutely forced to honor bargains to which they have agreed, even if the bargain

A major exception to the general rule: talking animals seem to have been adopted into this category, but these are generally
helpful to humans in most folklore, rather than compassionless. Helpful talking animals appear frequently in the troubadour
tales of the proto-renaissance of the Twelfth Century and in the Germanic folklore recorded by the Brothers Grimm. A second

exception: the Irish sidhe (pronounced “shee”) and some Arthurian fey-types are associated with unnatural passage of time
in their realms and with taking slaves or captives. This isn’t a universal constant among folkloric creatures, but it is a common
theme nonetheless.

Final note about the tables: since the concept of fey is a bastardized catch-all type of category, the monster-designer should
feel free to break as many of these general rules as may be necessary to create a good monster.
