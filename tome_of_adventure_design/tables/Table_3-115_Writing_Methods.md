BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF READING THE WRITTEN TRICK
Written tricks with a purely negative effect are basically traps. In general, if the trick is hard to read, donâ€™t also make it
misinformation. The one exception to this rule is when one set of writing is truthful (say, the guy with the bad handwriting) and
one is false (the guy with the good handwriting is a liar). In this case, once the party has figured this out, knowing which set of
information should be helpful down the road: they can get major clues when they find future notes written in bad handwriting.
A random mix of truth and lies, with no way to judge which is which, can be frustrating rather than fun. And then, of course,
there are exceptions to every rule!
