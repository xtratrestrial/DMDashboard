61-80
Give it a human-like head that has animal
characteristics mixed in as well
81-00
Roll twice on Table 2-2, mix up the attributes of those
two animals, and make the result bipedal with arms and
opposable thumbs
Roll again on Table 2-2, using this second roll to
determine a bunch of weird modifications to the
basic biped you created from the first roll. For
example, your bipedal fish-man now gets some
attributes of a badger. Go for it.
