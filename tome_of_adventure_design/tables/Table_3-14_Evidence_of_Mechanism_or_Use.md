Table 3-14: Evidence of Mechanism or Use
Die Roll

Type of Evidence (d100)
01-10
Cleaned room: evidences recent use, presence of oozes, or removal of evidence
11-20
Presence of tools: indicates recent use and possibly presence of something the tools are intended to be used on
(this thing might be hidden).
21-30
Scratches on walls or floor: can evidence presence of the moving parts of a trap, presence of a secret door, or
something that has been dragged from one place to another
31-40
Holes in walls or floor: these might be marks from impact (possibly from a trap or portcullis), might be vents for
the functioning of a trap, might function as a keyhole or contain buttons, and might be the lair of some small
monster
41-50
Pockmarks or corrosion on wall or floor: can indicate monsters that use acid, or the presence of a gas trap.
51-60
Aquatic tools: this includes fishing nets, boats, broken boats, fishhooks, buoys, or diving equipment. Indicates
presence of water nearby.

61-70
Recent painting or carving: some sort of decoration has been added. This obviously indicates recent use of
the area, and probably an intention to stay. A corollary question is why this particular sort of decoration was
chosen and whether it indicates the type of creature that chose it. Keep in mind that paint might be covering or
concealing something, and statues can also be used to conceal doors, trapdoors, and holes in the floor. They can
be faucets for gas, or counterweights.
71-80
Warning signs: these might be painted “Keep out” signs, or might be as primitive as a skull on a post. They
indicate borders and boundaries, and may disclose the nature of the creatures that put up the sign. They might
also indicate clues about who is being warned away.
81-90
Operating machinery: whether the machine is a water channel or a piece of incomprehensible complexity, if it’s
operating then someone turned it on and maintains it.
91-00
Furnishings and carpets: if an ancient area has new carpeting, someone is nearby. Carpets can conceal other
clues, and chairs can be trapped. Beware.

PART OF DECORATIONS
Sometimes, information can be gained by looking at a portrait (“hey, isn’t that a map she’s holding?”), a statue (“that sword in
his hand looks like the one we found earlier”), and even furniture (“that is a really, really, big chair”). Putting clues into decorations just doesn’t really translate into a random generation table, unfortunately.
