TRAVELERS (PLANAR CREATURE TYPE)
Travelers are trans-planar creatures that move across planes of existence on their own accord (as opposed to summoned
creatures). Perhaps the most important feature of these monsters, from the standpoint of designing an adventure, is why they
do so. What is their motivation for shifting from plane to plane, or from alternate world to alternate world? Obviously, most
of these creatures are intelligent, often far above the human norm. Predatory travelers should generally be treated as Horrors
or Demonic Creatures (see above) rather than generated under the tables below, which are designed to generate creatures with
more complex motivations than mere feeding.
