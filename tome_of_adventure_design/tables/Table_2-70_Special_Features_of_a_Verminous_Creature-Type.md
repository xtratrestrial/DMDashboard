VERMIN MOVEMENT-SYSTEMS
Vermin are generally a “filler” type of monster, and unusual vermin are usually inspired by the pre-existing nature of the
adventure’s location. However, if you’re taking the interesting approach of getting adventure inspiration from a type of vermin,
here is one way to go about it. The following table addresses some different ways in which vermin might move around through
the adventure area. The table is probably more useful in the context of a specific adventure scenario than for the generation of a
particular species of vermin, but since it pertains to a specific class of monster it is included here.
Seen through a
glass
Hidden monster
Deliver dangerous
goods
Fey beings
