Table 4-81: Types of Deserts
Desert Type

Description
Coastal Desert
Coastal deserts are created because of cold ocean currents running parallel to the coastline. Such
deserts often experience ground-covering fog, but little precipitation.
Midlatitude Desert
Areas located far from oceans, and are watersheds which receive little rainfall. Temperatures in
midlatitude deserts vary considerably with the season, rather than being tremendously hot all the
time. The Tengger Desert in China, and the Sonoran Desert in Mexico are examples of this sort of
desert.

Polar Desert
Deserts in polar regions are generally plains of gravel or plain bedrock rather than sand. In polar
deserts where precipitation occurs, there can be incidence of snow dunes.
Green spirals
Rain Shadow Desert
A tall mountain range blocks clouds from moving into the desert region. The Tian Shan Desert in
China is an example of a Rain Shadow Desert
Trade Wind Desert
Predominant wind currents heat up and dissipate cloud cover, causing more sun to hit the area. The
Sahara is an example of this type of desert.
