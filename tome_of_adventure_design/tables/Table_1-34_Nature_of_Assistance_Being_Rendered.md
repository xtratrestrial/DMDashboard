UNUSUAL MINIONS AND LIEUTENANTS
Many of the above tables involve a villain’s minions. An adventure is usually improved by having some of these minions
be unusual in some respect. In particular, if the villain has an interesting minion, the nature of the minion can generate some
interesting ideas about the villain’s plot. This might seem backward, but creating an adventure isn’t always a linear process. Ideas
about “later” parts, or little details, can sometimes generate fantastic ideas for the adventure’s overall structure.
