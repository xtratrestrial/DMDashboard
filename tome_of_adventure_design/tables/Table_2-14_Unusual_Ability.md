Philosophical
manuscript
09-12
Theme: don’t touch it. The dragon’s skin is adhesive or corrosive.
13-16
Sucks blood, might have other bat-like features including echolocation
A strange missile
17-20
Lives underwater as easily as on land. Might have fish-like features such as extra fins
21-24
Sings beautifully (and probably dangerously). This might be in a human-type voice, or it might be trilling or
whistling.
25-28
Theme: Perceptive. The dragon has unusual powers of perception that give it an advantage in combat. In
general, it will either be able to predict how it’s going to be attacked (defensive) or find weaknesses in the
opponents (leading to some sort of attack bonus). The nature of the perception might give the dragon other
benefits for things like avoiding being taken by surprise. The actual mechanism could include ESP, smell, high
intelligence, or precognition.
Held for ransom
29-32
Theme: Illusion. The dragon can change the perceptions of its opponents. The source might be to magically
produce visual illusions, or to use some sort of magical mind domination.
Tines, tongs, forks
and prongs
33-36
Theme: Hidden. The dragon can conceal itself, camouflage itself, or hide in unexpected places for an ambush
(under water, in shadows, in walls, on ceilings, etc)
It was thought
to have been
destroyed
37-40
Theme: Don’t hurt it (acidic blood, corrosive surface, or other downside to using physical attacks). This is similar
to the “don’t touch it” theme, but the effect only kicks in if the dragon is physically damaged. This could also
include reflecting spells, transferring damage to another, or being healed by certain types of attacks.
41-44
Theme: Spellcaster. The dragon casts spells, casts spells more powerfully than expected, or casts a wider variety
of spells than one might expect. Alternatively, the dragon might simply have an array of natural abilities that
mimic spells.
45-48
Theme: Summoner (wraiths of past victims, etc)
49-52
Theme: Venom
53-56
Theme: Weapon-user

Theme: Hypnotic. The dragon either has a physical feature that hypnotizes opponents (gaze, beauty, colors,
patterns, etc), or uses communication to do so (song, trilling, mental telepathy, soothing voice, persuasion, etc).

UNUSUAL BREATH WEAPON
A thing that turns
Unusual breath weapons don’t figure prominently in the unusual abilities table above, which is designed to focus on sparking
the designer’s higher creativity. However, for a dragon that’s simply a slight deviation from the norm, a variant breath weapon is
often all that’s needed – breath weapons, after all, are probably the most defining feature of dragons. If you want your dragon to
breathe fire, poison gas, electricity (lightning), acid, or frost, but in a different way than normal, don’t roll on the first column –
just roll on the second.
