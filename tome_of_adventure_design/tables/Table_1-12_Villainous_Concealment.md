Assassination. The Villain is targeting anyone who could identify him from a past
identity he wants to keep secret, or is killing those who know about his plans. In other
words, the villain might be trying to conceal himself or his activities; these aren’t always
the same. A villain engaged in secret activities might be completely certain he can’t be
identified, but still worried that his plot could be uncovered. Assassinations might be the last
resort when a villainous plot is already starting to fall apart. The villain’s minions might be
his targets, too, if things have gone badly and the villain is concealing his tracks.

Eliminating Evidence (damage control). The villain is trying to eliminate evidence of a
plan or crime that failed, and that he has written off. He might be taking several actions at
once: killing his own minions that were involved, killing witnesses, stealing documents and
other evidence, etc.
Eliminating Evidence (mopping up). The villain is eliminating evidence of a plan or
crime that has succeeded – covering his tracks, in other words. If he up a usurper on the
throne (to choose one example), he might still need to kill the minion or dupe who poisoned
the true king. Or, he might need to change some historical records that could reveal the
usurper’s non-noble pedigree. Most crimes leave evidence behind.
Frame-up. The villain is framing another person (or monster) for a crime he committed
himself. The target might be a minion, an innocent bystander the villain dislikes, or a
monster such as a nearby dragon (dragons being excellent fall-guys for arsonists). Remember
also: from the villain’s perspective, the enemy of his enemy is not his friend – he’s a potential
fall guy.
Lair-Building (rural). The villain is building a concealed lair to hide himself and his
activities from the group indicated in column 1. This could be the activity of a mindless
monster (in which case column 1 is irrelevant), or it might be part of the thought-out plan of
a relatively intelligent mastermind.

Lair-Building (urban or village). The villain is building a hidden lair within a civilized
community. Again, this could be the instinctive action of an unintelligent beast (such as a
giant spider nesting in an attic, or a ghoul making tunnels under a cemetery) or might be the
first step in a mastermind’s plan (e.g., an evil priest digging a secret basement-complex).
61-70
Group of

Organization (façade). The villain is creating an organization of innocent-looking
minions in plain sight, but with a secret agenda for the group. The organization might be
a cover story for existing minions (yes, we are all circus performers!) or it might be a way
of recruiting unsuspecting locals to join. In this sort of operation, the villain is primarily
trying to conceal the organization’s secret operations rather than to conceal himself; he
might even be a prominent citizen of the town or village where the organization is being
created. His plan might include recruiting people away from the local community to a rural
“temple” or “lodge,” or the organization’s base might be located right in the middle of the
community (for example, an innocent-looking store that actually fences stolen goods brought
in by caravan from the nearby city). To determine the organization’s secret agenda, you
might want to roll again on the Master Table. Note that this sort of plan is almost certainly
the agenda of an intelligent villain, even if the operation is run by a minion with lower
intelligence.
71-80

Organization (secret). The villain is creating a secret organization of minions, meeting in
secret with no cover story for their activities. This could be a secret cult, a plan to overthrow
the government, or the unification of wererat tribes in the sewer tunnels of a large city.
Secret societies can take many forms if you’re creative.
81-90
Secret identity (establishing). The villain is disguised within the human population, and is
building up a new identity for himself. He might have forged documents, or an altered body
form. In this case, the villain has created a new identity – if he has taken someone’s place,
see below for comments.
Secret Identity (learning). The villain has replaced a human in the community, and is
learning the details of his new identity. This is not a strategy limited to shape-changing
villains; anyone can pretend to be someone from far away. The villain might be making
some blunders as he impersonates the dead or absent target – he might not know, for
example, that the king was a vegetarian, or where the merchant hid the key to his treasure
room.

B. CONVERSION
Conversion-type plans are designed to win over the hearts, minds, and possibly souls of the villain’s targets. There is another
similar table later on called “Subversion,” and the distinction is that a conversion plot is designed to change the moral alignment
of the target, whereas a subversion plot can succeed perfectly well if the target never changes at all – as long as the target keeps
