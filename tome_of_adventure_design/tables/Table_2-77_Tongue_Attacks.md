EXAMPLE RESULTS
Let’s say you want to create a monster using the method in Part Two, which starts with Table 2-72.

The first step is to roll on Table 2-72. Let’s say that the results are a 20 on column 1 (for the Physical
and Special Attacks) and a 52 on column 2 (for the Special Defenses). So, column 1 gives a head, tail,
and a special attack. The 52 rolled on column 2 says that the monster has two Special Defenses and
one Distinctive Attribute.
First we roll results for the head and the tail attacks. We roll a 76 on Table 2-73 (for the head attack)
and a 17 on Table 2-76 (for the tail attack). These results indicate that we have a monster with a
horned head (one horn), and a tail that crushes and constricts. Furthermore, the monster has a
special attack. Rolling on Table 2-78 (we roll a 61), we discover that the creature emits some sort of
clicking noise, with a special-attack type of effect. Rolling on Table 2-79 (let’s say we roll a 23), we
find that the creature causes cold damage by using this clicking noise. Odd but very interesting.
Finally, we roll two special defenses on Table 2-82 and a Distinctive Attribute on Table 2-83. Let’s say
the results are a 45 and a 79 for the Special Defenses, and a 64 for the Distinctive Attribute. These
results tell us that the monster is immune to transmutation-type magic, can summon animal allies,
and that its death can curse or damage the killer.
Developing the idea: We’ve got a monster with one horn, a constricting tail, and a cold-based attack,
which basically gave me two initial ideas. The first image was a white, furry, tadpole-like thing,
which I dismissed as stupid, and the second idea was a white yeti-ape monster with a long whiptail. Neither of these is exactly what the table describes, since a tadpole-thing would technically be
crushing with its body, not a tail, and the yeti-monster would probably be getting some limb attacks
that the table doesn’t call for. That’s not a problem: go with the visualization, not the table.
Suddenly it occurred to me, though, that the tadpole idea actually works pretty well if this is an
aquatic monster. Take the head of a swordfish, give it an eel-type body with a long tail, and you’ve
got a neat, nasty, subterranean fish. It doesn’t need to be arctic at all – instead, it has a special attack
that causes cold damage underwater.

Ancient dragon
Rotting
Curse of the
Waters
Barricade of Time
The table suggests that this eyeless cave fish with its goring attack, tail attack, and cold-damage
clicking attack can also summon animal allies (more of its own kind, perhaps). I’ll go with that, but
I basically decide to discard the immunity to magic and the death-curse. The death-curse simply
doesn’t fit unless this is a really high level, almost mythological creature, and the immunity to magic
just seems like too much.
Obviously this example is just one way of approaching Part Two, but it should give you an idea of
how the tables can be used to generate a monster.

SPECIAL ATTACK DELIVERY METHOD
This table offers a higher percentage chance that the Special Attack will be delivered by touch, since the physical attack tables
(with the exception of Tongue Attacks) do not provide for the possibility of a physical attack delivering poison, acid, etc.).
