Author’s Favorite Method
The author’s favorite method for inventing a city is to begin by rolling for the identity of the town’s central open area (Table
4-25), and to assume that this says a great deal about the city’s personality. A city with its central area and culture based on a
huge graveyard is a very different place from a city that centers on a gladiatorial arena, which is in turn different from a city built
around a sacred flower-garden. This open area will be large, centrally located, and it will play a large part in the city’s culture.
Then draw a couple of main streets leading to the city gates from the central area, and a couple of cross streets so the city
map isn’t just one large hub, and you’re good to go.
