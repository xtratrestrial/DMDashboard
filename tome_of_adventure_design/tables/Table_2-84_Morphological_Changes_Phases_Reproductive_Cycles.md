Nature of Cycle
01-10
Egg-laying mating type transforms into warriors or workers in an ongoing, non-seasonal cycle. It happens all
the time so that there is a constant supply of eggs, egg-layers, warriors, and workers at all times.
11-20
Eggs are laid on land by predominantly aquatic creature, hatch into a feeding-type that lives on land until it
transforms into a predominantly aquatic creature that mates in water but lays the eggs on land.
21-30
First phase is a larval eater, and it cocoons or transforms into a traveler-mating form that lays eggs.
31-40
First phase is a swimmer form, which cocoons or transforms into a land-based hunter or grazer which mates
and lays eggs (in water).

41-50
First phase is egg-layer, eggs hatch into food-finder, food-finder transforms into mating form (traveler and
possibly fighter for mates), mating form transforms into egg-layer.
51-60
First phase is egg-layer, second phase combines food-finder, warrior, and mating form, second phase cocoons or
otherwise transforms into the egg-layer type.
61-70
First phase is the egg-layer, second phase is made up of three separate morphological forms: food finders,
warriors, and mating form of one sex. Warriors transform into egg-layers in the right season, which the matingform members compete over.
71-80
First phase is the egg-layer, second phase is made up of two morphological types; neuter workers and a
“hermaphrodite” warrior-mating form. These warriors probably fight a lot, since otherwise a hermaphrodite
form would create lots of population. A failure of this fighting cycle could lead to a horde forming, which could
be a nice adventure hook. Perhaps the hordes are periodic, too.
81-90
Hermaphrodite form lays eggs and then dies; half the eggs hatch into a traveler-defender form that goes out to
build nests for the other half of the eggs. Second half of the clutch hatches into more hermaphrodite egglayers.
91-00
Mating form lays eggs and dies; eggs hatch into a traveler-defender form which goes out to build new nests or
hives, then cocoons or transforms into the mating form. One form probably builds nests, and the other one
probably picks nice nests and fights over them in competition (health, fighting ability, plumage, etc.). The two
mating-forms might look utterly different, here.
