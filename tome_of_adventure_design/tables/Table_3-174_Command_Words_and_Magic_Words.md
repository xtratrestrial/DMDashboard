SARCOPHAGI AND THEIR CONTENTS
The Five of Swords
A few points about sarcophagi as they are used in dungeon-adventure design. There are some rooms in which opening
sarcophagi is like opening a box of chocolates – you never know what you’re going to get. In rooms like this, most or all of the
sarcophagi will be identical, or there might be “types” that can be identified by some hint in the decorations. The ones with red
stone patterns might contain ghouls, while the ones with blue stone patterns might contain treasure. A second type of sarcophagus room contains a couple of highly distinctive ones – there might be some of the “box of chocolate” ones, but the central
feature is the one or two very unusual ones.
