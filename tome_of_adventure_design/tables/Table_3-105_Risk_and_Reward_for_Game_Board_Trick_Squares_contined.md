Table 3-105: Risk and Reward for Game Board Trick “Squares.” contined
Die Roll

Risk (d100)
Reward (d100)
41-50
Lose a turn (note that this could include things like
temporary paralysis if the “board” is merely being
used as a design concept but won’t be visible as such to
the players).
Get the ability to slightly alter the a future move (e.g.,
to add 1 or 2 to a die roll in order to choose one of
three squares instead of being forced to the square
that would otherwise be indicated for the next move).
51-60
Solve a riddle or be damaged, inconvenienced, or
negatively affected in some way.
Get out of Jail Free card, or the equivalent
61-70
If the game board operates with a store of “tokens”
that are used, the square might be a place where they
lose some of the tokens. If the game board does not
operate on tokens, this might be a place where they
lose treasure. In this case, the attendant “risk” is that
they cannot proceed without paying what’s effectively
a “toll” to move forward.
Get tokens that can be used to advantage in later
“squares.” Tokens could include rune-stones or other
items that will not be perceived as tokens by the
characters, even though this is how they function, in
an abstract sense, for purposes of designing a game
board style trick.
71-80
One party member must stay behind in this square
until the rest of them complete the game’s sequence.
Why the party member must stay behind can be all
sorts of reasons. The simple “a cage falls on you”
is the brute force possibility. “You must continue
watering the plant until the others can reach a way
to carry it out” is another possibility, illustrating how
wide-ranging this type of risk can be.
One or more party members are transformed into a
stronger form, related to the game’s theme, which will
make them more able to succeed in the game’s future
“squares.” The magic would evaporate at the end of
the game.
81-90
A junction “square” that sends you on a sideline track.
The sideline returns to the main track, and might even
be a shorter path, but the “squares” in the sideline
track are more dangerous than the ones on the main
path.
A shortcut junction. The pathway forks, and returns
to the main path later, but you don’t have to traverse
as many “squares” as you would if you followed the
main pathway.
A trap, particularly a slow trap in which the players
must figure out how to “turn it off.”
Victory. In other words, the way to win the game
board is not only located at the end of the board,
there are ways to win it along the path itself. There
should only be one or two of these.
