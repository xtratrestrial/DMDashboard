Table 4-82: Desert Map Features
Area

Description
Badlands (clay-rich area)
Arid areas with high clay content eroded by wind or water are called badlands. They have a
number of unique geographical features including canyons, gullies, and hoodoos. A hoodoo
is a tall spire of rock left behind after the surrounding area is eroded away. Many of these
form because there is a more durable rock at the top, acting as a “cap” to protect the lower
portion of the spire from the elements.
Dunes
Dunes can form from snow in polar deserts, and from sand in hotter deserts. They have
a gentle slope on one side and a steeper slope on the lee side (where the blown-over sand
causes avalanches).
Dust Devils
Cyclonic storms of very small particles, reaching as high as one kilometer. Caused by
extreme temperature differentials in close areas.
Ephemeral Stream
Runoff from nearby mountains can cause short-lived rivers or streams in a desert
Exotic River
Most deserts are watersheds which receive little moisture (the moisture all goes to the
adjoining watersheds). However, in some cases a river with a very strong source, such as the
Nile or the Colorado River, moves through a desert.
Lakes
Desert lakes can form when there is sufficient runoff from nearby mountains. They are
shallow and broad, and wind can actually cause the lake to move from one place to another.
Loess
Silt deposits, often as deep as 20-30 meters, with one deposit 355 meters deep.
Mineral Deposits
Deserts contain metals no less than temperate regions, so it is possible to find valuable
gold, silver, or copper deposits. In particular, though, deserts have unusual mineral deposits
caused by evaporation. Not all of these would be particularly interesting in a fantasy
campaign, but unusual salts and other minerals might be used in magical potions, making
expeditions into the desert a worthwhile venture.
Oasis
An oasis is an area where underground springs or seepage can create small lakes, tree
growth, and crop growth in areas where precipitation alone would not permit crop growth.
The soils are not usually very good; they are high in organic content, but often saline.
However, it would be possible to have an oasis where the soil was incredibly fertile – it’s just
not likely under real-world terrestrial conditions.
Playa
Flat area caused by the existence of a dry desert lakebed. Usually crusted with salt or clay
as a result of the lake’s presence.
Ripples
Ripples can be as large as small dunes, but don’t necessarily have the gentle slope/ steep
slope formation of a true dune.
Sand Sheet
Flat sand. Boring, but this is what covers about 40% of deserts, as opposed to areas with
dunes. The reason why dunes don’t form is because the sand particles in a sand sheet are
too large for significant wind movement.
Wadi
Dry streambeds left by flash flooding or ephemeral streams. During torrential desert rain,
these can be extremely dangerous.
