TYPES OF INFORMATION
The following tables about information are not just for generating
adventure ideas; they are for use throughout the adventure design process.
There are three ways the players in their guise as characters might encounter information:
1) Clues: things the characters see and must interpret
2) Rumors: things communicated directly to the characters (whether true, false, incomplete, or embroidered)
3) Written Information: clues and rumors that are recorded in some form
A characteristic of
the stag
A binding of
spirits
CLUES
Clues are bits and pieces of incomplete information that the players (characters) perceive directly and must interpret. It is
Weevils got into
the flour
Like a worm
Gargoyles
Uses a specific tool
best to make their solutions fairly obvious; it’s much more difficult to figure things out from the player side than one might think,
especially when you aren’t paving the way for them with things like “an intelligence check.” And don’t do that! Die rolls used to
substitute for players thinking and deduction will rob the players of the feeling of joy and accomplishment when they figure something out.
But on the other hand, if the clues are too difficult, you also rob the players of the same feeling of accomplishment – it’s fine
to provide some hard clues that conceal really useful information, but most clues should be quite simple. It’s also obvious, I
think, that the difficulty of the clue should correspond to the usefulness of the information it reveals.
