WRITTEN RECORDS
Written Records are covered earlier in this book. See Table 3-18. The useful content of Written Records can also be generated on Table 3-17.
WATER LANDMARKS
Some water landmarks may already have been generated as a transition between areas (if you’re going through these tables
step by step). If this is the case, don’t feel obligated to put in more water landmarks, but if you’ve got waterway transitions, you
certainly have the potential to create a dungeon level that involves quite a bit of water. Which is always cool.
