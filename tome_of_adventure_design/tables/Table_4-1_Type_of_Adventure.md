PATTERN OF NON-DUNGEON ADVENTURES
The patterns listed here also apply to dungeon adventures, but when designing wilderness or other types of adventures it is
often more important than with dungeon adventures to step back and look at the overall structure of what you’re putting together. The reason is that in a dungeon, so many possibilities are hardwired into the map: you can’t go up or down unless the map
allows it, your visibility is limited, and there are only a limited number of pathways. In a wilderness or non-dungeon adventure,
you have to give some thought to the broader possibilities (both the advantages and disadvantages) involved.
ADVENTURE PATTERNS
• Physical reconnaissance followed by an assault
• Physical reconnaissance followed by infiltration (with combat likely)
• Diplomatic reconnaissance followed by assault
• Diplomatic reconnaissance followed by infiltration (with combat likely)
• Set-piece event with direct combat, or with diplomatic or physical reconnaissance followed by combat. Note: in
general, the whole reason behind starting with a set-piece event is to create a viciously fast-moving race against time.
• Exploration (physical reconnaissance) involving multiple encounters (assault, diplomacy, etc)

AERIAL ADVENTURES
Most aerial adventures contain non-aerial elements, such as a cloud castle
or a cliff-side, although this isn’t necessarily always the case. What’s meant
by an “aerial adventure” here is that the adventure contains significant elements
involving flying or falling. These might include travel-type adventures where much
of the adventure is a dangerous flying journey to another location, or adventures
where flying is a major tactical element involved in the way the characters must
handle a non-aerial feature. An example of the latter might be a tall cliffside with many

entrances that have no stairways between them, or, even if the cliff has stairways, there are
flying enemies that must be fought off while getting from one place to another on the cliff.
Oh, the irony
